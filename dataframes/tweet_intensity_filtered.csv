Got a #serious #hyper #predator #heckler situation over here
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
Yes I am picking up sticks and pine cones in my front yard
Seeing an old coworker and his wife mourn the loss of their 23 year old daughter was one of the saddest things I've ever seen ðŸ˜¢

This is the first time I've been sober on my birthday in 6 years. #recovery #sobriety #sober #soberissexy #sobernative
"Have any of you ever stayed in hostels overseas? My only frame of reference is the movie Hostel, and we all know how that went."
the thing with Twitter is i only remember to tweet when i'm bored or alone and then it comes across like i have a really dull and sad life.ðŸ‘½
I need all your attention! If I don't I'll pout..
It would appear it's a good year for the #blues
"Well, I had hopes for today. No go. #unhappy"

Does she really need to pout all the time - getting on my nerves #GBBO

Some questions you get on Twitter make you want to despair. We've been so battered. We complain but aren't convinced things could be better.
"it's still not sunk in that im seeing joe next month, im so grateful and excited shit"
"Rooney ! Oh dear, oh dear ! Fucking dreadful ðŸ™ˆâš½ï¸âš½ï¸"
That's how you start a season that's how you open the show #show #them #how #dark #hell #can #get #Empire
"I know I've painted quite a grim picture of your chances. But if you simply stand here, we will both surely die."
I honestly feel nothing towards either of my parents and it's pretty depressing
"Feminists should ask themselves, why they're so unhappy, and why they lack love in their lives. Is it b/c they are fighting a losing game?"
"life is hard., its harder if ur stupid #life #love  #sadderness #moreofsad #howdoestears #whatislife"
"life is hard., its harder if ur stupid #life #love #sadness #sadderness #moreofsad #howdoestears #whatislife"

"Happy Birthday Roy Buchanan, born on this day in 1939. #roybuchanan #guitar #blues #happybrithday"

Probs spent a grand total of five minutes sober since Sunday evening :) #freshers
On the wheel as we grow older and become aware of ourselves as individuals with a dull responsibility in life?
This whole #VanRE + extradition might turn into a Pandora's box. JT has no idea about that murky corrupt guanxi in China; Toad vs Dada ;-)
"... Huh. Perhaps... Because we're both so dreary, we get along well?"
Sometimes the support network is causing the damage. \n\n#support #Damaged #alone #tired #lost #hurt #nojustice #depression #surivivor #NoMore
