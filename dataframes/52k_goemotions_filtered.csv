"He isn't as big, but he's still quite popular. I've heard the same thing about his content. Never watched him much."
"I wanted to downvote this, but it's not your fault homie."
So happy for [NAME]. So sad he's not here. Imagine this team with [NAME] instead of [NAME]. Ugh.
"Dark and funny, but not really nice guy. He has yet to call the dead girls whores for declining to sleep with him. "
"I can't stand [NAME]. Especially since her ""tatooing my own face"" video. "
By far the coolest thing I've seen on this thread yet
"Honestly at this point I don't think there's anything that will make me feel better. Maybe down the road, but right now nothing is helping. "
"There has to be some repercussions for this judge, right? Considering the crimes, that bail seems incredibly low..."
Me too! First time in a couple of years!
"Ironic. He could save others from secrecy-enabled corruption, but not himself."
"""Oh, how DARE you discuss the disgustingly unhealthy and dangerous lifestyle I pursue!"" /s"
"Which totally makes it less funny for a person like me who has never seen this before, and laughed. "
Press fucken charges the moment they use your info.
>Did you just call me a liar? Sick reference.
It doesn't matter. You can pick someone with the #1 Pick that will never be any good...
I thought it was very good. The guy was one sick bastard that’s for sure.
"You're both wrong NBA is an initialism, can't be pronounced as a word. Oh man I love reddit"
No we're getting Kinsler and be happy with it
Hypocritical is pot calling the kettle genocide
Omg lala a housewife I can’t even imagine!
"[NAME] has always favoured [NAME] so I'd assume this means he's the next up, I just prefer [NAME] and find [NAME] a little overrated."
It’s the format. It’s like one of those bad [NAME] memes
I can't believe he got it while getting man-handled by two players!!
Lol. Build your own or make some tweaks to the printer.
I've never seen him play so hard on defense. This feels different this time is all I'm saying...
"Ones with close ties to SA, anyway. An escaped apostate won't exactly be itching to run home."
I really like this ring so I’m glad to hear that.
The [NAME] are all laughing at each other. They are divided. We need to strike them down while they are weak.
Allow me to describe the shock and awe I experienced seeing this: **Fuck no why u do this?**
"Integrated, Antwaarps speaking, second generation, not already wearing a scarf back then... unlikely. "
"Only thing TO know is that this motherfucker is obviously living his best birdy life and good for him. Fly high little buddy, fly high. "
>fail at reading comprehension >Other guy must be a troll ¯_(ツ)_/¯
"The possibilities are fascinating. In other times, I'd be enjoying watching the lawyers argue...!"
Sorry just seemed like you were trying to make it a [NAME] thing
People who hate [NAME] really really hate him. It’s quite fascinating.
So wrong. Most every denomination believes they are the only ones who are doing it right and everyone else is going to rot in hell.
"Something's wrong. The top post on r/conspiracy isn't completely anti-conspiracy? Wow, feels weird. /s(?)"
Makes me sad I'll never be with a beautiful woman.
Go play Farmville if you can't keep it up.
Hmmm I dont think I listen to only [NAME] if I last checked. These arent INTP playlists they're just playlists I like as an INTP
This is me and my wife. She squeals with delight whenever it snows and I start looking for property in Arizona.
"You’re right. My biggest pet peeve is the lights, it washes out all the colors and textures, I hate that BGs use them"
>The ABC’s hard-hitting investigation :/ Such a sad article.
"And only $300+ a night, beautiful but expensive."
Would you rather I hadn't posted this article? Don't want to talk about it?
"Hand ur phone to a buddy and let them send the text asking her out. Worst thing is she says no, but it's better then not knowing "
This one tilted concrete square in my neighborhood that I keep fucking tripping over.
Ya I thought that was odd too. I would’ve guessed [NAME] before doing this.
Disgusting!!! Where were the adults? The adults probably felt proud of their sons. Fucken toxic culture
No going back after switching to a safety razor. Even the most expensive blades are 10x+ cheaper than Gillette.
Bringing it up now because you and many like you made this sub a hostile environment for voices of reason. Eat crow.
😭 I wanted her to be on the top 4; now we’ve heard plenty of times [NAME] mentioned so pretty sure ain’t gonna happen
This is not looking good for China's typical method of say whatever the other side wants to hear then do nothing.
Im 13 I can't get a job..
I'm just saying you are demanding things of us while being nasty yourself.
Well they called and said there was a pricing discrepancy and they could not honor it. 😭 sad day.
"Ah yes, the poison. The worst part of any poisoning. "
"Yeah, and there's no better way to make a market more competitive than to regulate it more..."
"TAKE ME TO YOUR CRYPT, I WANT TO PAY MY RESPECTS!"
"Yeah I know, it’s just wishful thinking but I would be ecstatic if it came out today"
My mistake. I just glanced over your last post.
"I know the feeling, but you’re not disgusting. Happy new year!"
Would feel weird swiping right on a leftie
TL;DR No more Superbowls for [NAME]. Get ready for another winning season that ends in disappointment.
There's not enough salt in the world for her!
Idgaf anymore. I lost all hope in moids. I'll keep looksmaxxing for myself.
Man.. all I know is if I’m with a girl and she whips out a condom from her FUCKING SHOE it’s a no from me dog
"I'm really worried :( I sent a DM to them, I hope they will be okay... "
Yes. One of her fingers is getting a sore on it and there’s concern it may push her into needing braces.
That’s not true. She represents those who voted her into power.
That almost makes her seem like an actual human being.
I have a deep seeded hatred for close-minded people too.
"Look [NAME] is here ""Where the fuck was he an hour ago, gary, where!?"""
>They split up 5 years later after an extremely messy situation with Dr [NAME]. Very very long story. I would like to hear this story
"I don't really know how to explain because English is not my first language, I'm sorry."
Looks like one of mine too. Such a horribly raised entitled rude brat
It was a poor choice of words.
I like hearing about these positive encounters.
He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting!
"Yes the ammo health thing really is a chore. Too much realism. we want have some fun in a realistic setting, not a simulator. "
Id buy those shoes and walk in the dirtiest places just to piss [NAME] off.
Self-deprecating humor is mainstream now. A lot of hot people now have hobbies and personality traits that were once almost synonymous with dumpy/nerdy/ugly people.
You should have noped out of the whole thing the moment the racist with a racist character came into the picture.
I watched a really bad horror movie she starred in but I think it predated VPR.
ORaNgE MaN bAd AnD iS HiTlEr!!!! EvErYoNe I dOnT lIkE iS HiTlEr!
You are my beer god thank you haha
"This is actually so funny, this is something id expect from Australian sports media since we're shit at broadcasting but lmao"
oh my [NAME]. it was hurting my brain. i only saw the disappearing boot and thought i was missing something.
I thought that was a good pickup line
Cus the left doesn't give a shit about people who fought for the USA!
Sounds like a great way to accidentally fucking kill someone who might just be passing by.
I *want* to like R&M but people are making it really difficult
This just makes me feel inferior at this point.
That's got nothing to do with anything that's happened in this thread
All the people in this thread are fucking disgusting
All the replies take his quote a little too seriously
She is probably cheating on you. :(
But but r/49ers said it was just bad luck!
So can relate. Hot to the point I hated feeling good because it wouldn't last. Might as well enjoy the moment!
iT cAn'T bE sExISt bEcAuSE iT's a mErItocRaCy. -tech bro assholes justifying gender discrimination and systemic sexism
"I didn't delete it. Your moderators did. But that's what [NAME] do, they "
"OH DARN IT, THANKS FOR THE REMINDER MFER!!!"
"At least he's finally done one thing right. Utter fucking disappointment at every level, by every metric."
NEXT TIME! ON THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND!
"Ahh mate, come back any time and i'll make culturally inappropriate Third Reich gags and then we can get lit on bush chooks."
"Im color blind, i usually see blue as purple and red as green soo..."
Doesn’t matter does it? It’s a joke. No need to get a designer/graphic artists involved to communicate the idea.
I said stop though. What’s with right wingers and not understanding consent?
"I cringed so much just reading that tweet, I didn't even make it to the comments. That's my fucking President. :("
My wife is out for shabbos and I'm so lonely without her :(
I see. Thanks again for taking the time. I'm very isolated from the world so It's good to finally talk to someone about those things.
">more money than you I seriously, *seriously* doubt that. >doing something before this guys are outta the country Prove it."
if it wasn't him it would be someone else she's wasting her life on
"Unfortunate for him, but I'm bringing up players. >AND they can just stop being a support."
Not in Missouri according to my friend who moved up there
Yeah it doesn't impact much except when they break and cause billions of dollars in damages and irreparable consequences to the wildlife.
Sounds like you are the one with salty tears mate
"Im really sad, and there is alot more goin on but i dont know how to tell it."
Yeah it was a fun game. :D
"My nipples are rock hard right now, just ruined my shirt. "
"I swear of all the people that dislike artifact, the gwent crew is by far the most obnoxious."
I like [NAME] but he's biased. If he's planning to becoming a real journalist he needs to leave his bias at home.
I’m so sorry. You deserve so much better.
This sub is becoming a “Gamers rise up” parody of itself. This is ridiculous.
Not this sub’s fault the ((([NAME]))) is full of idiots
"> It's upsetting. What can be done? We'll have to take it to the high courts, let them decide!"
Okay I’ll call them tonight and cry on your behalf.
I’m glad you are here. You got this.
I once had a guy yell something obscene from the window of his truck and throw a half full beer can at me too... good times
I very happy with my character. I took my sweet ass time picking one that I liked.
WHO WON THIS FIGHT My thoughts: neither side did a good job at explaining their positions and this entire interview was mostly useless
Yeah it’s not like I want my cat to lick me in a sexual way that’s just weird.
"Like [NAME] said at the very end of the stream, “You’re still here and you can still do amazing things.”"
"Say what you want about me, I can take it... but stop slandering poor defenseless [NAME]..."
"If at first you don’t succeed...welp, nevermind."
"Morals aren't tied to religiosity, nor the absence of it."
I honestly don't know but the more attention something gets the less it gets ignored
Are you this awful about everything that isn't your own preference?
He’d definitely get dropped at some point and then all hell will break loose
"Ah ok, that makes more sense. I don’t think most [NAME] would see your last name and try to make it French, lol."
"Midnight has been 4/4 pro league teams they have played so far, so I wouldn't be too sure they're gonna be bottom feeders"
"That’s the hardest part for some to get over, but hobbies help and getting yourself up and out of the house and spending time with friends"
My goodness. Your such a fucking manchild.
it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.
this is so niche but i still felt that shit in my bones
Ugh. The Google Plus BB community is the absolute worst!!!
"But all-Korean teams don't always do the best in OWL/Contenders, look at Outlaws v. Seoul, etc... "

"> We're angry, but we don't want to be labelled as violent nutters."
Damn. I want to see some of those comments!
"> The porn that I downloaded was Brazzers produced. In case you don't know, Brazzers is ***anal*** about their IP. Ha get fucked."
Men don’t have it worse but at least society cares about women.
Listen to yourself. What other things do u want to shove down the throats of others in the name of tolerance and humanity? [NAME].
Well 216 is out now and Im crying. [NAME] why?
Poor Target didn’t make enough millions during one of the most hectic Christmas seasons I recall in almost 2 decades. Gotta save that payroll though.
Oh gosh that's no good! Perhaps the other options are better places to start
"My [NAME], check your corners people. I guess it's harder on console to let the team know though."
I tripped off 540mg of Robocough and my oil pen last night. It was absolutely wild like damn
"More rudeness, misogyny and sexism from [NAME]. If it wasn't so predictable it would be upsetting. [NAME]. "
Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action
"My favorite pod when they are fresh & clear. Sadly, all of my recent packs look like dark brown syrup pods. "
Im sorry I said something negative about your beloved Valve.
Nope! It doesn't matter how stupid you were being.
"“Wow. Just .. wow. Read a book, sweatie!”"
Plot twist: [NAME] is [NAME] estranged father
Please stop uploading twitter links. There's a reason people ask for/post mirrors.
"Because people that comment on YouTube videos are toxic, filthy heathens."
"Thing is, some fans will *never* be happy. There is nothing that can be done to please them. That's the problem."
She's a ~~chill cat~~ woman of few words.
I tip my invisible hat anytime I drive past this dealership. What an unfortunate surname.
"Barring an injury, [NAME] will be up by May at the latest. You're not going to sign him for one month."
Then I'll be accused of being a racist.
This is the worst I've ever seen. It really is
"eh, maybe. the tricky part is getting away with it."
Tbh bastion is still super op before it now I can just abuse him more
Does anyone have a link to the rainbow song clip? I tried looking everywhere and can't find it :(
It is amazing how social media is allowing maniacs to congregate. Social media is very bad for us.
"I don't necessarily hate them, but then again, I dislike it when people breed while knowing how harsh life is."
I'm sorry but your username is absolutely horrible lol
"So, I saw the video yesterday. I think there are real complaints by residents, but that video isn't normal, and absolutely crosses into antisemitism."
Sorry but I didn’t throw in the towel for my co worker. These feelings were present before she entered my life.
Interesting what you said about the crew and better to fly solo than with people who bring you down. I'll remember that.
"Cheers, I live minutes away from you, will check it out some time soon."
Not sure to downvote because genuine and encouraging or to upvote because sarcastic and hateful.
"No, it was believed that the baby absorbed maternal traits because the mother was the ""soil"" the ""seed"" grew in. "
"Yeah, what do you know about her? Her Wikipedia page is pretty barren."
Franchise QB's are leaders who set the tone for the entire lockerroom. [NAME] is a terrible leader.
Or you could learn to reverse park and stop whining. It’s a lot easier to park backwards.
Ok so the scape goat is gone. No more excuses now [NAME].
Oh my god.... They used [NAME] voice!
They call it the hub and spoke system. They neglected to include a wheel.
Fuck taking the high road. If I’m [NAME] I’m blasting the officials when I speak to the media.
Ah the infamous [NAME]. How I've suppressed that name from my memory.... Until now
Constantly worrying about her and not feeling pleasure without her presence could be. You need to talk to a therapist.
10? If they're teens their original joint apparently didn't last that long.
"Turns out you can polish a turd. The trouble is, it's still just shit."
He lost his shoes. He’s legally dead.
I know what you mean. I'm actually looking for a [NAME] irl. That's hard to find...
I'm 21. I've entered adulthood and I even have to face negative comments from family members. Adulthood won't save me.
Finally a whole season and 3 jornadas too late.
I'm happy I live in a country where machete attacks don't have to be a real concern.
Same here. The ones who know me and my obsession always let me know and it makes me happy.
"Oh, gotcha. I have a friend with unipolar depression who does have memory issues, so yes, that can happen during depression too."
I'm not a victim at all. You're just a desperate loser who spends money on a guy he could watch for free.
"trust me, you do not want to do this. i used to live with 2 party people and it was absolute hell. save yourself now"
"Sorry, you misread. I thought you'd written ""why had they done that"". IIRC, it's in the report they published. "
"Look! More complaining about people complaining, thus compounding the issue! What a happy little circle-jerk : ) You guys will never stop."
I'd punt her to another planet if she said that about my dog. Wtf is wrong with people. 😠
"The last thing I want on my team are former Eagles players. Fuck that team, the organization, and the shitty fanbase "
"Sorry to hear that, mate. Please get some professional help. "
"Also his Whirlpool seems to be bugged, sometime it stays for like 3more seconds even tho you don't get any damage from it anymore"
I have a bad one but I also have mild cerebral palsy on my left side
A surprise to be sure! But a welcome one
This hit me with de good ol memories
I know one time I mixed stuff up and posted the slashes instead of the asterisks to italicize. Oops.
"Not one bit surprising, yet also not really a men’s rights issue"
Seems like you jerk off looking at mirror while you’re crying
"My bad sorry, what I meant to say is ‘for our winning season’ not ‘in our’."
Well new years eve people can hit it with some luck in my area haha
We thought he was getting better but then he turned himself around.
Sadly that's probably the worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
I know a guy who is 25 (same age as me) and has FOUR. I would hate my life so much.
"[NAME] were the peak memes back when I first started on Reddit. Honestly none of the meme subs are good, they're all pretty cringy. "
"I'd be so upset about this, I hope you got to enjoy it thoroughly :)"
"You can't be worse than [NAME], your hired!"
Sometimes you gotta hate living to love life ya feel?
"I mean... it's horrible and all, but isn't it also a record high every year..?"
With Everyday passing day without a good signing I feel like we got robbed in this trade
You shut your mouth. shut it right now. *sobbing uncontrollably*
“Inside sources” really don’t help the story even if this is true
Randomly watched arrow this week and I think each year is more confusing and I didn't like it! At least [NAME] is still there and always shining!
Just be glad you’re not his wife
How dare they not have the foresight to realize he'll become a president we don't like decades later.
Honestly I’ve seen kids that age do really gross stuff
"There is nothing this Government could cut that wouldn't upset someone. Sorry, but weez broke."
This is why I clean my belly button every day. That’s disgusting
Sounds really boring so I hope you like it
I forget it all the time too.
"I swear, this is the most brutal one of this year yet. "
that's why im here in the overwatch university subreddit you fucking idiot.
Not available in my country. Can't believe this has to be a thing in the modern age.
Every time I think about how close we were to getting [NAME] it hurts a little bit more...
That's what I ended up actually doing.
If I had that I’d stop working and travel full time. I do not understand the avarice of the wealthy. It makes no fucking sense.
"I know this is late, but I can’t believe I missed this. Love it."
Contractions is equivalent....body can only deal with...us women with labor.....I don’t like the way this person speaks.
"$42,000 fine over a JOKE is unreasonable. "
Wow! Good for her! I’m so glad she was able to see through the bullshit!
"I first liked [NAME], but disliked her after [NAME]."
I find that relatable: I too am terrified of myself.
Why everyone mad i think it was a joke .people these days over sensitive my [NAME].
"He's ridiculous, I've never watched out west when he was on the Spurs. But damn. Hope He stay."

For sure...sometimes I feel like I will just evaporate into nothingness as the stranger in the mirror looks on.
I ride our half-orc barbarian by clinging to his back. He hasn't seemed to notice yet.
The fact that her pillows are brown is way more disturbing to me
Yeah being up by 20 every game does that unfortunately
"[NAME] man, how have you not suffocated with your head so far up your ass?"
"Chart was clearly made by an 18 year old that thinks 30 is ""old"""
I think they think that they have created the best cod ever and everyone who doesn't think that is wrong
You'd be stupid not to do this.
Oooo sounds lovely. Armpit hair on “fleek”
Those backpack leashes suddenly don't seem so bad
"Texas, I'm really just mad at myself for not double checking. But now I have a year to find something better"
hey at least you've got a friend group chat
"What was that behind the back nonsense, criminy. TO THE BENCH"
That partially explains why season 4 was such a fucking mess
Oh that's a shame. I bought it for $100 but willing to go wayyyy under the original price.
A fucking power outage during a hurricane and your car is fucked.
No! That’s not how I meant it! Just trying to start a conversation & I love Tool.
Based on the down votes I can say this is truly an unpopular opinion although it shouldn't be
I feel sorry for her son that must have been super cringe
Aw no. Don't tell me you are out of epic quips to rek the trumpist incel fascist nazi?

No i didn’t all i know is that i binged 3 seasoms of it.
"Huh, so there should be no more men's and women's sports, bathrooms, prisons, etc.?"
Unemployed now re: those crummy health issues. So that probably helped.
"I'm suprised they didn't use the classic: ""[NAME]?"" "
It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!
"Wah, the poor dead fascist thug! What a fucking tragedy. Every dead cop makes the world a safer place."

Its hard to explain i feel everything is distant.
"I do that anytime I see something pointy. I'm just like, ""I wonder how it would feel to stab my eye with that."
Wait there are more psychopaths in this world than are diagnosed? Color me shocked
Not at all. I'm not going to argue with someone who doesn't understand what a strawman is.
Noooo no more NEXTs anymore! They are obviously just a kid who is excited to discover music. Give them a break! :/

Seems like a strong negative reaction to something you say you know nothing of...
They'd probably just use it to buy up armies and navies for tyrants who oppress and reign with blood and horror or some shit.
Looks like you took a bath in manure.

"Important part of this, surprising it's not there. "
Well I am happy you believe that.
I know a dozen local school administrators. What the hell are you talking about?

"Honestly, same. I was miserable at my admin asst job."
Well I'm glad I decided to go to McD's instead of doing those lines!
how the absolute fuck did black panther get nominated for best picture? its marvel action schlock at its worst. blackkklansman on the other hand is a great movie
The loading screen has the circle at the bottom that just keeps spinning. I tried uninstalling the app and that didn't work either.
"there's no ventilation shafts in the dumb things, block the exits and make a bonfire."
I don't think a [NAME] would agree....
"Ahh damn! Gotta pay attention to that, never even knew!"
An online poll that the Berners didn't manage to swarm? Color me shocked.
Some rambling paragraphs about what a waste I am and how sorry I am to be a disappointment to those around me and that sort.
Hmm I wonder why the bot copy text LAOP says is in NY when the original post says LAOP says he's in TX
"Wait, I see the problem, you are changing the word observation to assumption, which I think you know is disingenuous."
And you can amend a tax return. She can’t amend a terrible life choice like that.

It’s even creepier when it’s happening TO you. Source: I carried two VERY active babies.
glad you made the trip from a fellow austinite
"No problem at all, glad I could help :) Cheers!"
That's way dangerous to keep then together they may break out and start feedig on the other ear buds to gain heir strength
"What the problem? I mean, steak? Good. Doughnuts? Good!! I don’t see an issue. "
Thank you for posting this. I never heard this particular interview before.
"Oh [NAME], oh no, no no no"
> its exactly the opposite of what I do to get a girl in the mood This is super creepy
"Yeah. It didn't even work, that's why nobody went crazy. "
Thank you for reminding me about how much I love the JJBA abridged series.
At least it made for hilarious responses by people being aghast by the price.
I played in the WSHL last year and this really isn’t a surprise. It’s crazy how unbalanced the competition is in that league
"Going through a divorce right now. Her saying ""I love you and maybe we should go to counseling"" would make me more than happy."
"That's really the only standard of your life, whether or not it makes liberals furious? Sad."
They went to game 7 of the Conference finals last year. Probably would of won if [NAME] didn’t get hurt.
I have said many times [NAME] should just quit playing around and open a full on grocery store. Seems like a logical next step.
"Fuckkkkk I'm doing Psychology lmfao, am I gonna fail at life now? "
its even worse because the starter kit is like $70 too right? So in reality she probably made closer to $30
Stars don’t get chicks my dude. Good way to let everyone know you are a fucking goober
The car analogy is silly because car problems are physical and material and hence clearly factual diagnosable. “Toxic masculinity” is a squishy theoretical concept.
> that hurts my enjoyment of society. Then what could you possibly mean by this?
Your comment has been removed for shaming. Thanks [NAME]
There would be a lot of sexual tension in faze...
Grats man. I hit my second live one today coincidentally! Feels good :)
"Not with me, no. I’m a true social butterfly "

I BELIEVE! I am sad that likely no one else will see it besides me...
[NAME] hand must have burned holding that blasphemous law book.

I think you might be underestimating some people sadly.
"You didn't write that very clearly at all. I Wish You Would is a cover anyway, and I highly doubt that was the point of the tweet."

Wow you’re mom is truly living by the love first motto that is [RELIGION].
Its hard to look at. Its just gross.
I believe it was a severe dislocation as opposed to a fracture. Regardless....poor guy....
It’s not satisfying at all. If this wasn’t [NAME] it wouldn’t be popular. Interesting timing considering the [NAME] debacle too.

Absolutely. It takes me back to a much happier time. When I die I hope I go to San Junipero.
Thats a move i havent seen before
It's bizarre that it's considered normal to intentionally brainwash people into murdering psychos.
It's all hypocrisy and projection. The people smearing him work for [NAME] and [NAME].

A lot more potential than Crowder. Maybe not my best comparison
A girl that ugly only liking me isn't a compliment its an insult and it shows [NAME] hates me
I’m so glad someone linked it. You’re doing the important work. 🤣
"And also, turning someone's hands into spaghetti is cruel and inhumane and not a reasonable punishment for theft."
Fuckin' HockeyMod is almost as inconsistent as the Sens are.
The fact [NAME] met her at the airport should tell you all you need to know about why they did it. What a farce.
Not all of us young teens eat tide pods Mom would be sad
He appeals to the conversation. Basically doesn’t have a firm stance on anything of much importance and will flip flop based on his guest.

"The 5 days got an audible ""[NAME]"" out of me. That's terrifying. "
I fail to see the downside of that.

I kill him before he kills me during the date
Perfect World was my first mmorpg that I played for years. Super fond memories of the game.
"So you ignored the part I was clearly responding to, though, and decided you needed to explain the other thing. That makes sense to you?"
The “figuring it out” part seems really hard
I will take it a as serious question. Sorry. I am in Europe
Worrying about [NAME] during a game is ridiculous. Especially when he's currently 6-11 from the field.
This was the most fun I've had watching a game since [NAME] 35 point game
I had a feeling...crazy what that guy can do to his body.
I’m gonna love it if that happens to me
This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
Surprised he's in. Imagined he was concussed. He was on another planet for a bit.
Are you kidding? She literally got on top of him while he was tripping and he's the asshole?
Pretty normal! I have a friend who is exactly the same :)
Made by [NAME] who also was involved with Sacred Games so I think you'll enjoy it.
There's an Arby's/Long John Silvers near where I live. I'm glad they don't cross menu items.

"In other words, being a woman but not identifying with your oppression. How special"
Did [NAME] mention the astroturf pitch after today's comfortable 3-0 win? He certainly made a big fuss about it after the loss at Rugby Park.
I didn't see it either! I feel like the kid at the birthday party that didn't get a piece of cake...
"I wouldn't even call this a CB, she wasn't offered anything and turned it down. Still sad, though. "
"Of course I have. It’s nothing, absolutely nothing like this. Its just a few much bigger pieces that break apart now."
I love the fact that he is a complicated character makes it challenging
This is a toxic behaviour.. get rid of him as soon as possible.
I'm just reminding everyone. you're not helping the situation by being pedantic
Combination of lapses in defense and the continuing saga of the Sabres' god awful PP.
I'd be shocked if he knew much of anything about the EU.

Go to the police. Get a restraining order. That is not okay.
Hard to expect much when he has not been involved in the offense for most of the season.
Cheese Most of my friends love cheese so much that I’m scared to tell them that I can barely even bring myself to eat it
Uhhhh... didn’t y’all just eat the light lunch that you said you wanted on your preference sheets? Shut up.

Thank you so much. Happy New Year to you to.
I’m fine with that. I’m happy to be banned from subs like that.
Right? He actually came across as level headed and mature here so that was a shock.
"Lol, pretty sad that even in your fake revenge fantasies you come across as a huge asshole."

It’s sad that some parents can’t accept some simple mistakes.

I'm phobic of needles and babies so that was NOT a picture I wanted to see.
"Wow, the cropping on this shitpost is as bad as it gets."
I wonder if this will ever appear on BotW. Since it's so straightforward there probably isn't much to talk about.
This obviously led to your slow downward spiral into apostasy. The spirit never returned after skymall destroyed your testimony. 😜
I don’t even like [NAME] that much but she completely failed to engage with his work critically. Her interpretations of his arguments were shockingly poor.
Our volume of immigration does not mean it is easy to get in. The bar is very high and there are many applicants.

Our [NAME] is going off bro. [NAME] is gonna out-Jack you off.

Chipotleee! [NAME] Damitt! Closes in 39 Seconds.. but we made it!! Loved this guy!!
It’s really hard to watch for some people because of how awkward and... just how stupid [NAME] is in this episode
I have said many times [NAME] should just quit playing around and open a full on grocery store. Seems like a logical next step.
I didn’t get to watch!!!! WHAT HAPPENED!!!!!
I'd worry about traffic more than the TSA.
Funny how the whole rape thing just vanished once he was appointed.
Did you noticed they removed my post? Yep.
"Alas, Windows, so I'll go a-hunting. Thanks for the info, though!"
"Wow, essential oils can now replace oxygen"
Right before that he called [NAME] for getting barged in the back and nearly kicked in the face. Weird performance. Didn't change the result mind
"Yikes ... that's a bad one. Thanks, and good catch."
That guy with the orange jacket looks so distraught. Feels bad man.
"I used to hate them too, but since vikendi I’ve gotten pretty used to them "

"[NAME] dude I see [NAME] so rarely that I forget that he's the OG ""Fuck this character fuck this stupid game"" king. "
I can’t believe this blatant police brutality
Good point. Personhood isn't officially granted until you become property/ a bond of the state.
All the people in this thread are fucking disgusting
">""Le Painting""??? What hell is that? - [NAME], 2019"
My dad wears that sweater every game day! It’s in much worse condition however
No. Going to a competitive high school was harder and more stressful than all my adult endeavors combined.
"Even with their new location around the corner, they are still incredibly awful. By far the worst [NAME]. "

> She fucked my bumper up and I will forever hate her And her insurance didn't repair it because???
The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
It’s pretty clear UBI is not going to actually Make the character interesting. We should stop deluding ourselves.
I love doxies. They're absolutely the best most pain in the ass wonderful loyal dogs.
Well good for you man. Enjoy :)
A lot of people seem really ticked off at the idea of an honourary doctorate.
Discuss and follow a case an onsessibg per the case are different. It's odd. It's the only conviction on earth where we see this.
"This is objectively wrong, what the actual fuck lol."
"I like [NAME], but this entire sequence was hilarious. Poor guy. "

I love this! It's nice to hear of a positive outcome on here.
I've seen guys who didn't know each other start conversations about sports. It all seemed very effortless.
Sorry man. Didn't realize I was talking to a Russian spam bot. Please give my best to [NAME].
> For the same reason it wouldn’t permit business with an expressly racist/sexist/etc. business But those practices are illegal at all levels already.
It was a poor choice of words.
Please feel free to laugh at me if I am wrong but I have seen this movie before...this game is over.
i feel like they are hateful towards everyone but that might be me not understanding their community
"[NAME] can’t you see, you’re being way too loud for me"

"[NAME] looks too creepy,but it's a very nice drawing."
A classic question. He wanted to create to share His love and existence.
"On top of the animals listed, you can also unfortunately see foxes in Oatley Park closer to sunset."
then its lost man. So sad!...its terrible

It sounds like you'd have a great time with Final Fantasy XIV.
"I would not recommend water panties, you might find things a bit squishy! ;)"
Its much better. Inhaling burned particulate plant matter is very bad.
I was flabbergasted when I saw it.
"That used to be my favorite view on the planet, but now it’s just rage. I can’t look anymore."
I was there in 89-91. Some of the best years of my life.
I'm guessing they give up garbage time scores alot when they have the win in hand.
Why a 14 year old? WHY WEAR LIP STICK WHEN KISSING PAPER?
Well you needn't worry about it I won't be coming back to that floating turd you call a country
"Agree. Keep trying, then if your rejected every time. I'm sorry your done."
"That does suck. I’m sorry. Having recently been ghosted by someone who I thought was a very close friend, it’s a terrible feeling"
"Oh, I’m so sorry! Good luck, I hope your 3000% more successful than me! Sending love and support!!!!!"
You know it’s bad when you grab the toothpaste and start reading it
Feeling is exhausting. They used to feel those things and now they feel nothing because they're so burnt out and tired
"Even Rolling Storm seems better, and it is not very good."
"That made me smile. Thank you!! And yes, definitely replacing her on my reference list lol. "

No need to be sorry if you are seeking to leave ignorance. The only bad thing an ignorant person can do is willfully and knowingly stay ignorant
I still can't believe that dude in Whangarei is still allowed to run his business. I wonder how much longer he will keep it up.
"Pretty terrifying. Imagine if you went on a school trip, did nothing, and came home to this."
We are atrocious on defence.. I hate this tactics of defenders playing th ball around.. slows down the creativity so much
i remember my grandparents seemed to hate each other. my grandpa had a hearing aid and when grandma starting nagging he'd reach up and turn it off.
I love how [NAME] touted the Hong Kong model as something beneficial. What a joke.
I don’t believe so. I got it when the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit was in my city.
[NAME] damn it I love this but it had a STRONG socialist undertone and I just can’t fw that
"There is a difference, because unless something had given them encouragement, they'd still be feeling negative about it. "
Is that a real tweet? From the actual president? Not a parody? I can't tell anymore.

"Like the poor redhead in True Blood that got vampired as a virgin, but worse."
That's the reason I am terrified to wear contacts on duty. I'm afraid it'll get stuck between my contacts and eyes and destroy my pupils.
See as sad as I am I can’t hate anyone here.
I am more than pleasantly surprised I clicked this link
Increase in robberies on pot shops. I really hope not though.
Wait this is what chill looks like? Some girl told me that I look dead amd I flinch at the slightest movement. You really call that chill?
I was hoping for a new album surprise came out of nowhere when i saw the notification.
**Takes away membership card* HOW DARE YOU SIR!!!
No matter how hard you scrub it WON'T COME OUT.
So can relate. Hot to the point I hated feeling good because it wouldn't last. Might as well enjoy the moment!
Good riddance. I'm surprised it lasted that long. [NAME] is trash.
Poor Guy. Come back stronger than ever!
Yeah Q was bad card I was just bloating the pot. I definitely feel this is one of the worst hands I’ve played.
Goosebumps had the same take on those too. Those books used to scare the shit out of me
"Yeah like feminism! Not at all artificially inflated with terrible facts, information and school systems."
He’s also talking about pushing [NAME] in front of a train. Kid needs the old bill coming around for a stern chat.
The junkies that hang around there can make some good jokes about getting blitz'd
Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
I'm not super happy about having to see his face in the news for at least another 6 years.
I mean you can want a break from something and still enjoy it.
Not defending [NAME] at all but this is just super sad if it’s true...
Google image him. Hes NEVER had a good haircut.
Seek out a therapist? It sounds quite depressing n I wouldn't want it overwheming me.
I was also [NAME]. We all make mistakes
No. That’s an actually pot plant. You have to do some extra work to keep it blooming each year.
"[NAME], don't fucking front the pass if your help defender is [NAME] he will not help you"

"The UK government's No Deal plan is basically to do exactly what they would do if the withdrawal agreement passes, with some caveats, I believe."

No! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans lol

Hey same here!! The first week of April!
Baby rape. Can’t make a funny joke about it.

"This is the most scary [NAME] can ever be to me, cause it’s also the most real he could ever be 😂"
"Im all for putting rapists in jail, and honestly i dont like [NAME] politically but they tried so hard to taint an innocent man in jail and thats sad"
This one is hitting people that knew him hard. He was such a happy guy all the time. Hopefully they catch the bastard soon.
I mean that’s still weird bro... it’s like a college grad feeling up a junior in HS
"Yes, they suck for making a profit off of people who are proven to be high risk. How dare they!"
Police numbers in London are at their lowest (per head of population) in twenty years. Those fucking cuts!
It’s very unlikely that they charged the rider again.

Some things are worse than death. Being a dairy farm cow is one of those.

"While Girl Scout Cookies and weed are old friends, I am unfortunately not in contact with a dealer of the latter!"
I had an ex like that. I know why I couldn't function with his way of life. Totally unproductive.

"That's true, but I was surprised to find absolutely ZERO information about a person who , presumably, has quite a bit of power and influence."
"It could be, but I hope it's abandoned. I haven't been too impressed with the flash forwards. "
I really enjoyed it actually. The world and the monster seemed really cool an original idea.
Damn straight! My folks only knew when I told them about it!
What? No way do I want to see a Boston coach behind our bench!
"you said that he said ""women shouldn't be allowed in the workplace"" which is dishonest and false"
Cats are repulsive and they don't deserve to be pets
And then he calls the fans crybabies for saying his movie sucked. Just take the L dude.
"Traded me away, the bastard. Kidding aside, it's the annual r/hockey trade deadline game."
"""Ummmmm *Eeyore*? Duh?"" *sighs violently, rubs temples* (This is when I leave before I do/say something stupid)"
Who brings a gun to a middle school in the first place? This kid was not right.
"I'm so happy for you and so, so, so proud of you. It's HARD to talk to your doctor about this stuff."
I did this a couple years back. Daily binged on Simpsons. So Good.
You sick fuck it has heads and arms we can’t eat that.
Yeah feel bad for people paying 200 to watch this crap. Better hockey watching my sons novice games.
"I’m not saying I disagree, but it’s important to note that those are all defensive guys"
I feel like I lost focus... I have not accomplished anything and the clock isn't really stopping
Huh? Mutts are usually healthier than pure-breds. It's the pure-bred dogs that have weird genetic issues.

"This sub no longer has much in the way of standards, sadly."
"The last time it happened I just said, ""No"" and closed the door"
This hurts to hear because we know it's true. There are 16 year olds who have experienced more than me.
YPG has carried out numerous attacks. Yet you seem to judge them on the few messed up things they have done.
No. Screw him. It IS a demanding job. Physically and emotionally draining. You deserve a hot meal and a friggin hour or two to decompress.
Sorry man. I didn’t know you were on reddit. Didn’t mean to steal your stuff! I totally would have tagged you
Woah... I'm shortsighted and I can get 2 pairs of glasses for €149. $500 is insane!
sure but that doesn't change the fact that he's probably not a neccbeard
Never thought of that. Now i dislike Heaven more than before.
"Good [NAME], what a waste of [NAME] time. Wait, is [NAME] a nutritionist?? WUT?"
I would think they probably couldn’t take it if you tried
It kind of blew my mind to see that after reading some of the most generic advices in that post. Who the f* upvote these posts?
Well I mean this game is so stupid in a lot of ways tbh
Could be to lead the police on the wrong trail to delay being caught
Woah nice. Did you enjoy it or was it a completionist pain? I wish I could get into [NAME] but I just dont find the fun.
I graduated in 2002 and had history books that ended with [NAME] 2nd term. I had great teachers but terrible materials.

[NAME] I hate plant thieves. They’re almost certainly ppl who should know better.

He’s oppressed! An innocent man is going to be killed!
"It's a last resort when I forget my iPod, I swear"
"Wow, who can afford this one? "
You really should not group people with ones you have had bad experiences it will not help you grow
Sports are fucking garbage. Basically just religion but with jerseys and beer in public.

I loved my LCR. It made me feel like a police chief from the future.
I will not being awkward if I am being myself but I just scared
Sad but exciting to see him in a place where he might perform well. Hopefully he stays injury free.
I actually feel assaulted by this video.
"that's weird, I thought we already had too many outfielders? edit: this was a joke."
“What a bummer. He ded. I look at sky. Maybe bird make me happy.”
This is exactly what happens when these fields are controlled by political ideology and not by a unbiased search of the truth.
It’s sexual harassment because it was done with a sexual mindset. It’s not that hard to understand.
I predict one of them is going to be complete garbage and the other one gonna be competent with some critics calling it better than the original.
Because men are weak/stupid enough to let them.

This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
I'm sad I had to come this far down to find this.
It's a weird way of saying you don't want to see my penis
Remember when the media ignored all of the horrible things [NAME] did? Including what he did to Syria?

I kinda like the swirlies in the hair. But then I saw that her eyebrow is actually just the hair and hated it.

Hey didnt say being fat and short is bad
Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.
I'm enjoying the witty comments but anyone want to throw in some analysis?
Yeah this is downright spooky; she's not even using that face mask.
There were rumors for a long time to work out and I ended up making it smaller.
Dont forget [NAME]. He was a reliever converted to starter. Hes got some ridiculous pitches just needs to work on consistancy

I’m actually suprised they all didn’t follow him and now they all have to repeat junior year.
This should be the norm instead of the exception. Sadly the leaders in law enforcement are almost always more into politics than principles.
Interesting I wasn't aware of this. Maybe proving the undue hardship is difficult but technically allowed? I wonder what counts.

Rainy weather must have gotten them... no idea. But i've never seen a dead hummingbird and saw 2 within 5 feet of each other :(
I'd say that the vast majority of the population is and was rightly looked on as horrific. Christmas music makes me feel like a real [NAME].
"That was a brutal shift. Honestly he should be playing sheltered minutes. Team needs [NAME] and [NAME] back, give bulk of his minutes to [NAME]. "
Honestly? No. I just feel sad for you guys
That's literally insane considering we're talking about [NAME] and [NAME].
I think you're right. She has oodles of cash and young grandchildren to enjoy. Going through that hideous gauntlet again probably isn't that appealing.
This happened to me 6 months ago and I am still hurt and actively trying to talk to her... Idk how to stop
"Still. He didnt have to go after that ball. Thats just his nature though, he doesnt give up. Hope its not very serious. "

"[NAME], what? Why are you even here. Fuck off."
"I mean, to be fair... She did say sorry. /s"
Yeah - thanks - I vaguely remember this. I wonder what her net worth was year by year? Too lazy to investigate.
Riding your bicycle down Powell is *a stupid fucking idea*.
I like [NAME] but I disagree with him here. Then again it's not much surprise that a mega rich globetrotter that lives next to [NAME] would hold such views.
Pissed at you for not allowing them to live in ignorant bliss?
"> They are all one entity with the same goals. Agreed, sadly."
I wanted to slap her when she told him she could have died and it would be his fault.
I don’t remember [NAME] saying that tbh
He's also a chaser and is convinced that shouting at someone is an escalation from a shooting spree. He is incredibly dumb.
Right?? It makes no sense she’s horrible
I would be impressed if [NAME] ate 15% of his weight every day I wish I lived in a state where the contest was valid. Stupid NY
"Somewhat valid question, if he was 11 when the game came out then he can shut up yeah."
I laughed. But I'm really not sure if I should upvote.
Because they want to. Why do you act like a goddamn weirdo about stuff like this?
The reason we’re stuck in the shutdown is the democrats. Plain and simple.
[NAME] shitting the bed like a 4 year old with diarrhea

She was a surrogate. [NAME] fucked the force which created [NAME] in schmee
It started to compute for me when I was “right” all the time but never ended up getting what I wanted.
Both consenting adults so nope not creepy
Umm... educated people who think that killing a fetus after viability is abhorrent?
"I can't see a way forward, neither the government or the opposition wants no-deal or to cancel A50. "
Think this is the first time I’ve ever disagreed with [NAME]. [NAME] at SF WCJ at PF sounds horrible
"But once it's born, if its parents can't afford food, shelter and medical care, it can go fuck itself."
You cant.Its the idiot civilian drivers fault for probably just staying behind him like a zombie. Unless they come out with heated trailers soon.
"Wow, well I think that game just aged me 5 years..."
"Or you just say ""Sorry, this isn't working out"", and leave."

If I got killed by someone while they're stunned I'd uninstall my game.
Welp....I think your question came across as judgmental. Why did you ask it?
Maybe. The only other time both sites of players should be fully baked is just before a world cup but that's not a good time either.

This. Nothing would make me happier than the see the gNats hamstrung for the next decade because they gave a ridiculous contract to a hometown hero.
Every time I think about how close we were to getting [NAME] it hurts a little bit more...
This is one of those hobbies where the exit strategy is paralysis or death.

[NAME] will be livid if he does not get a burger but see [NAME] stuffing his face.
Really? Shucks! I’ve never seen it...thought it was a perfect add. My bad.

"Man, such a shame we only got three movies. They really didn't wrap up all the plotlines."
Gotten death threats and people compare me to flat earthers.
No where was I blaming [NAME] for the lose but he didn’t help. I just dislike his game.
It’s an imperfect poll demographic group skewing erroneously towards a “No”. [NAME] was incredible this week.
"[NAME] a fuckboy, he was never your boyfriend."

"[NAME] knocking [NAME] out. Somehow, I didn't expect the brainwashed soldier to betray the kids."

Yup. That doesn't contradict what I said- this isn't a derailing conversation that I was starting.
I watched my team get deep dicked in the natty. I understand
I'm sorry you have to deal with this. My mom does the same anytime she loses something. She accuses people of stealing whatever she lost.
They're really cute but I'd never in a million years own one because they literally smell like week-old pissed on rugs.

"Thanks, we were kinda enjoying it at the time too"
There’s a reason southern states have a massive teacher shortage. Please do yourself a favor a consider that before you take the leap.
I know this might be an unpopular opinion from reading this post but I have a gut feeling that [NAME] and [NAME] would pair up really well together.
I would think I was in a horror movie and lock the doors. Lol
"The ""richest"" country in the worlds royal palace banquet hall filled with cheap mass produced junk food and they love it."
"Really visually haunting though. For me, it makes me think of strange alternate futures and dystopian sci-fi worlds. "

He hates the Falcon because his dad would leave him all the time on it as a kid
I think [NAME] did such a classy exit! Hopefully people don’t give her too much hate. She comes from a good place.
For 3 months so far. I’m not sure because I never had any successful withdrawals yet.
Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming.
There is irony in what you guys are saying.
I feel like she’d be more than half-way there if she just fixed those eyebrows...
"not really. but those people that go out of their way to say stuff like ""have a blessed day"" or whatever kinda creep me out. "
I highly doubt that the ChiSox offered him anything more than $210m. Either way it’s inexcusable for the yanks not to match
I'm sorry but your username is absolutely horrible lol
The nfl has been the outcome of ref interpretation and flag throwing for years. Why are we surprised this continues?

I mean I like the park and I was surprised by that poll too
Ohhh. [NAME] is my absolute favorite person ever. She just gets better as the season goes on. Enjoy!
Waiting for both of these things is torture
This’ll end the way these stories always end.
I'm kinda afraid to ask but did anyone reply?
And I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
That's kind of sad to be honest.
True. You always gotta be careful. It's pretty sad actually. I feel used and abused.
"Andromeda is that type of game that has extreme potential in becoming a great game, but it botched it in all the little things."
Because [NAME] had a foot injury that I think he sustained at practice for the second half of the year.
"No, it would not. How the hell is that evidence that [NAME] didn't commit the crime?"
"Yeah man, fuck the man. Can’t have people getting free stuff or have any creative marketing ideas."
It’s not so much that I enjoy money and more that I do enjoy scamming people.
The last statement just seemed like a bit of a jibe.

There is no evidence connecting him to the crime.
Was just wondering about the mobile thing. I only use mobile and I've never noticed anything odd. It's not something people would care about anyhow.
[NAME]? I'd be surprised if he plays.
Greasy bastards are getting part of what they deserve. Some fines just don’t seem to be enough sometimes

There's really no need to test for congenital defects with a mixed breed.
Except [NAME] still went with the happy ending instead of ending it at the Aningaaq scene.
"Hate that scene? Believe it or not, jail. "
" anyone who hasn't seen this, it's unbelievably bad."
"We're are going on a trip, in our favorite rocket ship"
When I got to grow old yet... They'll either remember how much damage it all is just ridiculously macabre.

He got all ball. Watch it back. Just because he hits the ground hard doesn’t mean you get a bailout
It's such a shame that the game forces you to use the q-tip and prevents you from equipping any other weapon.

"You spend time in The Donald, do you not understand irony?"
That is not a side swipe. That's a full on t-bone. But I hope they all made it through somehow.

"This one is by [NAME]! Your suggestion was funny to me, and you've been blessed with your joke being DR Onion #20!"
"I’d tell her nothing, that freaking weirdo would just never see my kid. The End. Disgusting."
Then go fucking cry you weak minded piece of shit.
Right? I think [NAME] needs to be careful cause I could def see [NAME] snapping.

Maybe it's as dangerous for [NAME] to whip people up talking about treason and betrayal and all that as it is when [NAME] do it. Fancy that.
"Fortunately, finding yourself and deepening your spiritual connection with the world only takes about 4 days in a beach hut with a thatched roof."
I’m sorry this happened to you. I’m glad you got out of it.
That's crazy; I went to a super [RELIGION] high school and I think I can remember 2 girls the entire 4 years that became teen moms.
That isn’t a prediction that is exactly how Crisis on infinite earths played out

Some of us disagree with the socially constructed sexual binary concerning how we were assigned at birth.

Happy New Year everyone! It’s 11:42 in CA 2019’s almost here

Will that's what that poor child was just taught. Some parents have no idea
It’s really hard to watch for some people because of how awkward and... just how stupid [NAME] is in this episode
Game day activities would be my guess. Not positive though.
I'd say the guy who was going beat [NAME] face in is the worst character on the show.
I already like the game. I don't to make the wins gimmicky for the game to be fun.
Especially weird considering [NAME] went to Fresno State and [NAME] went to Long Beach State.
We’re all bible on this blessed day

Wasn't there some sort of human Cylon orgy in The Plan or am I misremembering? Because I have bad memories of [NAME] and sexytimes.
"Bro, it's only game, why you heff to be mad?"
It'd be easier not to do it at all. I don't think it's meant to be easy.

It makes me feel good. Wholesome is a very subjective thing.

"For real though, I do apologize. That's a bad run of luck for sure, it's such a rare syndrome "
"Whenever you get a smelly one, don't you feel ashamed? Like what disgusting thing did I do wrong?"
"I used to sell appliance parts. Yes, I need your model number. No, the part you are looking for isn't ""standard."""

"Is it cruel to give your kids medicine when they don’t know what it is and why, if they need it?"
You’re not a loser. You’re a whole and complete person unto yourself.
When I was maybe 8 I discovered that I liked hot dog buns with just ketchup. I shortly discovered what heartburn was.
Maybe we'll just stop moderating for a while to celebrate TWOW.
That was around 5 grand but cheers and hope wherever you go in life keeps you happy and striving to go higher!

"Nah, share it then down vote it in to oblivion."
"Yeah, well your just jealous that you don't have a cunt like me."
"see, i'm over here thinking ""i hate sports"" now if you could just take my balls and go home"
There's always something endearing about a reply trying to keep the enthusiasm going. You enjoy that new toy as much as you can.

I’m concerned this story does not have a definitive conclusion
"America is not a country, it's a fucking business. if you have zero money, no one cares about you."

People who hate [NAME] really really hate him. It’s quite fascinating.
Oh no! More non-existent performance issues to complain about!! Can't wait to be playing it while all these self-righteous gamers take their noble stands...
Dementia is in my family so this is pretty exciting. I also have to wonder if this bacteria could cause other kinds of mental illnesses..
I should've left after the first period ended. That was brutal.

I wonder if the formal letter from the psychiatrist will help if cops just decide to shoot her first :(

This might be my favorite scene in the whole series
"Slap her hand if she is trying to force you to do anything! Tell her not to put her hands on you, and enforce it every time. "

"Excited? No. Sitting back with popcorn? You bet. Sorry, privilege of not living in the united States."
Being in a 3 person friend group fucking sucks sometimes m8 I feel like the least loved a lot of the time
Not really if they are busy. They may not even take a break. But again if they are regularly not responding than it is probably an issue.
"How to PRETEND to have ice powers? Wikihow, *do you think this is a fucking game?!*"
My money is on [NAME]. Doubt [NAME] is back up next yr. [NAME] looked.good last preseason. I was surprised he didn't beat [NAME] then.
"I take that part on faith. There’s no “proof”, but it’s also an entirely unfalsifiable claim."
How the fuck do you moan tho
I like [NAME] so far but making shots that you missed in the first half aren't coaching adjustments
"Hi u/CareeningDirigibug, thanks for posting this however I am afraid it has been removed as this video has already been posted within the last week. Hope you understand."
Scary. I bet youre fun at parties.
"Go lie somewhere else. Go to Faux News or something. They,ll believe you."
And you assume they are part of the dominant culture because of the color of their skin. That is self evident racism.
"Wow, I stand corrected, it's *even worse* than I thought!"
What dose are you taking and how long did it take to help? I've been trying the Lazarus 50mg/ml. Not seeing any obvious improvement so far.
Wish you did more. Sounds like she deserved worse.
"How dare you care about your physical and mental health, you shitlord you! /s"

"When did they stick to those policies, sure the US isn't innocent, but fuck that? This hypocrisy is unbelievable, it's cringy FFS."
He has been ghosting me whenever I text or call him. I know he has been getting them though. As they are always left on read.
that's weird... playing Smash Ultimate usually just makes me feel like drinking.
I'm surprised no one's talking about the guy in the picture. What a thrussy!

He didn't blow anything. She blew it with him. What a fun guy!
"> I'm clearly not even a student I guess you've never heard of ""you"" being used as a general address."
Your passion for [NAME] literally put a big smile on my face. Stay wavy!
I do remember this and wanted nothing more than to kill that guy
"This is so hard to sit through, I can't believe the swearing from this dood, it makes it all the more unbearable"

"I know. Honestly, I'm applying to other districts. Tired of 56 miles round trip daily for a miserable job. "
Now THAT is a murder by words!

"The no rape was my favorite part, so glad people agree"
"I don't see a mom referring to a group chat as a ""thread""."
I have cried in hotel rooms before thinking about the loss from discovering it is a lie. It's tragic and wonderful at the same time.
Kotaku never ceases to amaze me with the horrible decisions they make in posting stories that can ruin people's lives with no confirmation or validity.
I'm happy I live in a country where machete attacks don't have to be a real concern.

"Technically, going 1 forward and five backwards is still a 4 step backward defecit so they are not moving forward "

"Sadly, yes. You'll only be able to craft weapons with fixed Attachements."
Believe me when i say not having a job doesn't change anything. It's an endless nightmare being ostracized from people your whole life.
I am but me and my SO live separate lives.
For real tho let's dump our powerplay coach

same but with cats. Puppies are really high maintenance and make me angry when i have to take care of them.
I call bullshit on this anon said they were “walking” ... you know they were in the scooter cart.
Because it's not mildlyinfuriating that you have to ask strangers to not be assholes?

"He ran as a [NAME] in the Senate primary and then declined the nomination. Multiple times. He isn't ""honoring"" shit."
"Oh come on, you can't mention Psi-Ops without linking the theme song!"
Can’t believe we’re letting [NAME] go. So much energy since he’s come on.
[NAME] and [NAME] Funny thing is they both had a feud too and were in the ring at same time a lot
By far the coolest thing I've seen on this thread yet
Really sucks that he's not going to retire a Sounder.
What the fuck is The Baffler? I can't even go there at work.
Partywolf had 178 losses in a row? Are you seeious? I can't believe that
The only thing keeping me warm in this subzero temperature is my fucking hate for [NAME].
Destroyed property is the same as lynching someone for their race.
I’d love it if the Star Wars license was revoked from EA and then Obsidian make another KOTOR game.
"Our draft choices are horrible anyway, it doesn't matter where we pick."
I agree with everything you said. I still fell sad for her but this is the consequences of her own choices
"thank you for this, i feel less alone now. i’m glad you overshare on this stupid website :)"
my favorite moment in the history of the show is when he thrashed that woman.
Kinda reminds me of Arctic Monkeys' 'Favourite Worst Nightmare' cover art
Op forgot to mention his son has a rare scrotum disorder where the balls and shaft are reversed. Poor guy :(
I don't see anything about harassment in that statement. Weird.
The good news is you’re catching the possibility of it early. And medicine has come a long way! Giving you lots of good energy

"Wow, didn't expect this thread to get philosophical."
Ugh. I know that interchange too well. People around here have been driving bonkerballs the last month or so too (more than usual)
Insecurities exist even for people that are attractive. Even hot people are just like everyone else.
Your brother is in a freak cult that ruins lives. Forgive him but don’t listen to that bs.
"Oh, I would refuse to do anything really nasty, with profanity or violence."
It's weird to think of a functioning email account that's existed at the same time as the Twin Towers
"IDK about you, but associating things with [NAME] do *not* make me want them more. Even delicious Cheetos. "
Wondering why this hasn’t been made a thing yet 😂
"I'm sorry, no. The hostess was 15. I was 24. At the steakhouse, only hostess girls answered phones."

"I think they were hoping he would be the [NAME], that didn't happen."
"Seriously, check his food. It is upsetting his stomach."
"In our society it is more shameful to pay for sex, do drugs and to gamble than to praise the death of innocent innocent victims."
He could have easily taken a real camera from a legitimate source and change the price in Word/Photoshop and then print it out.
"Suffice it to say, I understand why you want to build one, although I disagree with both the solution and how you arrived at the conclusion. "
Seriously? If he spent the same amount of time doing anything else would everyone be bitching that he’s addicted to that? Doubtful.
"IMO, cheaters are only sorry they got caught, not because they betrayed their spouses and had an affair. "
Everyone who is complicit in all this should be punished and questioned as to why they allowed this to happen. Complete disgrace!
You sick fuck it has heads and arms we can’t eat that.
[NAME] didn't want to win though. She got what she asked for
That's what worries me the most - the exposed glans. Is there anything you can recommend so I can prepare myself for underwear etc?
You shut your stupid mouth troll. Thy absolutely matter
I would have laughed it off and walked away. Last thing I would do is ask the internet if I was right or wrong.
Im definitely gonna check the bushes around the burn where everyone throws their targets from now on. Im not over it i feel bad man.

Sex is gross and gross things are immoral to conservatives unless they are doing them.
"Why didn’t she celebrate, she redirected that one in!!"
"The title is a lie. I dislike what the APA is doing as much as anyone else, but how bout we dont sensationalize it."
Advocating for rape and torture of women on a whole and even inciting men to do it seems like it should break the rules.
That was awesome. the gross spin by [NAME] and the one legged glider by [NAME]. beautiful
The biggest cringe is actually all the people commenting she's a man
I don't even cook the steel cut! I just love the chewiness! I'm usually fuller longer with steel cut too.

Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
"I like [NAME]’ “I’m tired of losing, I’m not a loser”"
I don't know how everyone is falling for this lmao. Cringing a bit.
I like [NAME] but he's biased. If he's planning to becoming a real journalist he needs to leave his bias at home.
Cancel as soon as you can it’s far more enjoyable!!!!
"This is me today, I have to do a 1-2 MINUTE presentation and I’m freaking out about it"
Oh [NAME] if I was 9 and my parents did that I would cringe real hard

"Why would the landlord pay it if electric isnt included. Sorry to OP, need to cut the heat down"
He is actually good now. No teddy but he was great last year before he got into shit
Nope. I’m not wrong. Flipper superficially inflate housing prices without substantively contributing to their value.
"No, every movie shouldn't be like that. But a good protagonist is a good protagonist! "
"As soon as he was about to jump I audibly let out a “dude, just don’t..”"
"What game do you think that is ? Because that'd be Tetris or Minecraft my dude, not your teenage greasy neckbeard crap. Sorry."
Yo but that RivaL lineup tho! That's gonna be so sick
[NAME] I forgot the [NAME] administration literally invented a mass killing whole cloth to make a political point. So much has happened since then
i thought i was the only one who felt this way!
That was an horrendous season to an otherwise amazing show
"Congrats! That could not have been an easy step to take, so I'm so happy it's been a positive experience."
I miss wally he was so likeable
This is such a dumb statement considering the Rams have benched [NAME] for [NAME] with a ton of success.
I think the mushroom photos are a joke about his penis.......
Holy moly. She's terrible. You dodged a bullet honestly
I'd say the pecans is the biggest mistake
> No one bugs me. And yet you're scared to take your family in public because of Patriot Prayer?
"Klokslag 12 I find really enjoyable, horror movie podcast, Im not a horror fan but I find these dudes very entertaining"
Honestly i have no clue. Just got my feelings hurt by the mean things he was saying to nurk and wanted to cyberbully him in response
"For crying out loud, all they had to do was use the smegging wipers!"
"Guys, even worse: He *paid* someone to set it up. Wow. "
"The rich are horrible, horrible people..... and yet we keep voting GOP to give them more tax breaks, the hell is wrong with us?"
A concept that doesn't map to reality other than as a metaphor.

We are all [NAME] on this blessed day

I’m glad people are calling your lying ass out about CF.
That's literally how all fighting games are.
The phone calls in the first 10 minutes are absolutely damning.
As high as ~72% in black families. Truly heartbreaking what the expansion of the welfare state has done to the black family.
He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.
I'm a Bioware fanboy so obviously biased. I even enjoyed Andromeda. Haha.
Purdue's worst loss is Notre Dame (93 Kenpom) New Mexico is 187 in Kenpom. Good try tho
I love those moments where [NAME] finds a teammate opens and whips the ball at them but our guys are tuned out and don't expect it.
"My childhood horse died due to twisted intestines. Very traumatizing, since he crawled over and put his head in my lap at the end."
This made me sad. I hope you find happiness.
I love reading anti gentrification comments. Because they always sound so stupid.
A girl that ugly only liking me isn't a compliment its an insult and it shows [NAME] hates me
Not ok. They could have easily given them a drug test if they really wanted to know if they were on drugs. Disgusting.
OMG this is gaming history in the making. Lol I can't w8!
So happy for your strong stance and to help him on his way out of your life.
"That's awesome. I never realized it was attributed to [NAME], though."
Damn how do you post something directly to the front page?
"I find this super relateable, I had no idea others felt the same way. "
I agree. It seems the recruiter is a poor communicator and I think that is where some of my apprehension is coming from.
It's soccer. He was faking the injury anyway.
"It' kinda ironic that ""Winners"" are actually losers (they haven't realised that yet)"
I wake up with a smile knowing that there are almost 5 billion WHAMEN to RESPECC in the world
Not a single one of these allegations are of Russian collusion. It's more perjury trap nonsense.
"I blame all of y'all, y'all told [him he] was funny"
This sounds like disgusting wasp propaganda. You're being paid by Big Wasp aren't you? Confess!
Dumb people. Poor person. The wolf was the only one who wanted to help!
You didn't need to split this into two posts...
She is an asshat for driving on the walkway but fuck these guys. They should probably find something better to do with their lives.
Not for us it wasn't. Video please!!!
"I thought it said “now my biggest fear is the thing living inside my casket” like, *weet doo feek?!*"
Do not use logic dude. Not cool.
Its all good until that episode where [NAME] traps the bat on [NAME] head comes on and she screams bloody murder and wakes us up.
"I am happy for you. No, seriously, I am."
"+1 Thought I had depression, turns out I just wasn’t being happy enough! Who’da thunk it."

Dude seriously they got some really weird and specifically targeted propaganda on their TV shows

"weirdly enough drug addicts are still human beings, shocking I know "
Oh wow. Thanks! So this person was going for that.
She’s a disgusting snob.. Feel bad for the workers. :(
If she loves the place she’s at why leave? There’s something to be said for that. Idk your all’s financial situation tho
"Shockingly, some people continue to educate and improve themselves. You might benefit from it."
The secret and walk away endings are not cannon.
I used to watch it’s always sunny with my cat. She loved it. Now I can’t watch it without crying.
Can't relate because the sadness and loneliness is constant 😎
This actually made me squeal like a little girl! Thats awesome!!!! Im so happy!
"omg, id cry if this was my store "
I will. If you ever need help I ain’t afraid to put some people straight just holla.
They all say that. Mine said all the same things too and then just days / a week later met and started dating someone.
The Button was amazingly fun. By far my favourite reddit memory.

Let me add to them - it was awesome. Also unexpected!
I’m so sorry you are going through this. Sounds like an awful experience.
Yeah I've become extremely cynical since I started making these sorts of realizations.
fuck off. let people enjoy what they want to enjoy when it doesn't impact you.

Nicknames like that get me all hot and bothered.
Fear of awkward and inconvenient encounters. What can he do to you?
No. That's something you can't prove unlike American support to KCK.
Its a funny joke but it's delivered horribly
">not a cure-all. Since we don't have such a thing, is this not the next best option?"
My neighborhood is majority Haredi dude. Getting upset when a minority moves in is bigotry.

Three years ago I did! Ended up hospitalized for 5 days. I can say that I'm in a much better place now. :)
I like how he wrote many of the TRUE [NAME]. I wonder what a fake [NAME] believes in.
Wow this was awful. What kind of audience do these morons have? I mean no one with the money to buy that junk would watch these fools

"fuck lacy evens, she has not been impressive at all"
"Seems legit. Supremacy was big enough. In fact, it's hard to see the scale on screen with that size."

No hun your husband is screwed up. The way he treats you is no way of a man of [NAME]. You deserve better. ❤
“The weird thing is she’s got a tattoo of our company on her back...” lmfao
I want someone to just spoil every remaining elimination for them.
Funny. He said the same thing to me. I don’t even have a daughter.

I knew this was stupid when the shittastic music came on.
Day 7 is tough... Not as tough as day 15 but tough
My kids graduated college two years ago. Guess I missed it?
you guys got hate in your heart
It was extremely sad ... because you can tell the reason why [NAME] is the way he is.
This looks like an obvious joke to me. Most of you are getting baited.

The fact that [NAME] was not mentioned in this thread confuses and upsets me.
I think I might like a front end web developer job but not positive since I've always been in healthcare/science

This child does not understand the economy
She’s trying to motivate him to have a normal life after prison. She’s just not doing it the right way.
No way would I give up Albies even in a 1 for 1 scenario.
Ehhh but as a survivor I hate noed and hex ruin why would I run them against someone else
"Right, that makes sense! I wonder if the person I met in real life would acknowledge he's more of a fence sitter than childfree, haha"
Long straight hair on the face is going to look quite odd I would guess.
"I watched that worm fish sauce thing. So gross, disgusting, bleh, NO,NO, and HELL NO!!"

Shoutout to my fellow retail workers stuck working on third shift during New Years
Comparing [NAME] to a tantruming toddler isn't new but comparing him to one's *own* toddler is bizarre.
It's also not worth the costs because most of the time people are being petty don't actually have a claim to make.
Right?? The hypocrisy with the [NAME] situation is STAGGERING.
Excellent work thank you for this. This is why I love Reddit.
Huh. So it really comes down to looking at her senate career vs her AG career.

Um....Yes? I would love it if everyone didn't believe in [NAME].

its disgusting where our society is. free tube sites need to be banned

"Said it all year, I think losing [NAME] hurt this team in more ways than we'll ever know. "

[NAME] being the most manipulative person in the house was not something I expected

"if he ended up with that chef, damn that will break my heart for sure."
"I know, and the unfortunate thing is many of my friends in this area have had somewhat similar experiences with dudes who just are just total creeps. "
That scene traumatized me the first time I watched it
That is by far too strong of a passive

That sounds awful. Do you like that schedule?
There is still time.... though I dont expect anything to change as Activision dont care about the community hell neither do Treyfail

"From ""woohoo!!"" to blood curdling screams in a matter of seconds."
Downvote me into oblivion but both [NAME] and [NAME] shot around 35%. However one they say he balled out and the other one was struggling.

I’m a HR professional and deal with this all the time. You’d be surprised how ignorant most people are about their paychecks.
Good deeds don't buy off being shitty. This is why [NAME] is remembered as a monster.
He said he says it on his own but I don't want him to say it at all. I feel like their bio mom hates me

Where the f are you going to school that you are hearing such remarks semi regularly? That's horrible!

No way would I give up Albies even in a 1 for 1 scenario.
"Why are you defending [NAME], [NAME] clearly intends [NAME] to come across as a bad leader. Good leaders don’t get murdered bu their men."
That seems crazy that you can't hit higher frame rates. I can hit 80fps consistent with a 1080. Something weird is going on here.
"Welp. That sucks. I always check left and right when crossing an intersection, getting T-boned is one of my biggest fears."
So many of Pokimane’s fans are creepy 30+ year olds. I feel so bad for her.

"And then you're stuck on that medication for life, sounds like a scary trade-off."
Win what exactly? A meaningless game in a very long season to be swept out of the playoffs? No thanks.
"He’s one of those players that you would love if he was on your team, but hate if you have to play against him. "
"Yeah man, gotta suck it up and be a man. /s"
This is maybe the lamest way you can say that.
Character and emotions are not the reigning champion one year earlier...
And your folks thought that that Liberal Arts education would be worthless!

"Leader is an aura perk so you can't be affected by it yourself, you can only affect other people with it. "

Never thought I’d see a comrade here

The only happy ending I enjoyed on this sub. Good job.

The amount of overreaction on this thread is too damn high!
Shocking that a fat DnD kid is this self-important. Remarkable.
Fucking fuck! 2 (or more) sets of fucking socks in fucking sandals.
"This isn't about football, [NAME] is a horrible dude."
2016 was also the worst year of my life
It's more like depression is the default state. We live in a depressing society.
It’s not you. These subs are terrible. Even beautiful women get insulted on there ugh
Wtf you missed the Tigers 2005 dynasty
Never thought I’d see a comrade here
No way! First I’m hearing about this
"I am happy to receive constructive advice. If someone is short, or not constructive, I will react to it."
Hope you had fun atleast; it's amazing to see up close in person compared to the camera.
Women have a right to their own bodies. Your comments are horribly patronizing. They indicate that women intellectually develop slower than men which is sexist.
How long do you think manga will go on? Its fairly long now at 216 chapters and I think it's in it's late stages.

Anyone that actually takes the train daily can tell you that. And I do feel its getting worse.

The saddest thing about this is that most people truly in need are the last ones to ask for help because they don't want to be anyones burden...
"Wow, sorry, bruh. I didn’t realize we were in the presence of genius. Please elaborate."
Get out. And take your facts with you.
I’m afraid too. It’s the not knowing what will happen that scares me.
Why it's bad for a union rep to be siding with ownership in the middle of a contract dispute on Twitter of all places?
"They cant see me, bc I cant see them!"
"i ended up crying and breaking down once i got to my friends house, i'm so sorry that happened to you as well :~( "
"I mean, is that really a guilty pleasure? It sounds like the coolest thing I have ever heard. "
I would agree. It's unfortunate and brutal in its content and in the responses in the thread
I just had an overabundance of fudge. I took several pounds to my regular dispensary and they were thrilled.
I feel like this happens to me every single time I shop there. I dont go in anymore because I'm tired of being followed.
"I dont mind these people dying, what bothers me is that some random bystander could be smashed by this guy should he fall"
Hmm I wonder why the bot copy text LAOP says is in NY when the original post says LAOP says he's in TX

My mom and I do the same exact thing. I hate it.

These are worse than the [NAME] ones [NAME]
Problem is as soon as someone criticises Israel they jump up and down and scream anti semitism

Technically it’s the abdomen. Stomach and belly are just informal synonyms. That girl is a racist and an idiot.
"College was the worst and the most miserable time of my life. Adult life, on the other hand, is the best I've had."
That's unfortunate but can't blame that lawyer for doing his job.
I assume you mean how men are guilty until proven innocent in rape cases and how many places refuse to accept women can commit rape
this is stunning footage of [NAME] dressed as a sheep.... and now after beto parody twiiter account was banned... it was allowed back

It was definitely [NAME] goal. The stadium announcer incorrectly gave it to [NAME] though.

"Yup, even if they had a very rough life... Nobody ages thaaaaaat badly."
I was wondering if that would happen. The story I first read was crazy.
Lol seriously. I mean Vardos was really cool but other than that the story was so bland and predictable.
Maybe 2 years ago the time wasn't right for your relationship and now it is. It's been long enough to give it a second chance imo.
Yawn. They’re toxic together and their only trait seemed to be getting naked together.
[NAME] you people are so fucking dumb
I would normally give them the benefit of the doubt but they've really damned themselves today. Their hypocrisy is incredible.
They'd probably just use it to buy up armies and navies for tyrants who oppress and reign with blood and horror or some shit.
“Attack on masculinity” I’m dying over here you fragile motherfucker.
American democracy is weak but it's not dead. If the intention of your comment was to discourage people from voting then you are the problem.
That makes me feel even pettier. Thanks!

[NAME] the amount of protection that you are wrong *because* you are an outlier at all.
I don't care. I shouldn't be forced to suffer allergies and a messy car
"No, it's just that OP made that part up. The article didn't say anything about femenists."

It is true. But the real reason for the problem is the selfishness of the people.
This girl is really hot. tight biker suit and all that.

I've never been this sad in my life!
Can confirm. I've been trying to get out of bed for an hour and 15 minutes

"That sounds really agonising, to ask for help and have no one hear you. What's going on for you right now?"
If that’s your experience then fair enough but I couldn’t have a more disparate experience.
"So, that's super illegal in the U.S. And a cooler is not worth slicing someone's finger tips open. "
LN is flawed by design and BTCs limited on-chain capacity cannot carry mainstream LN onboarding.
yesterday was a fucking travesty to the game of basketball
That treatise is working well for the environment! 😉
"fuck lacy evens, she has not been impressive at all"
"Disgusting. This is blatant nepotism, and that man should be ashamed."
"No you don't, you love lies and liars. "
Can you repost this as a Brokeback Mountain meme? “I can’t quit you [[NAME]].” ;P
A year is way too short. You won’t know the impact of Brexit till 2030 really.
I don’t believe the mislintat or the big joke parts
The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
It's disgusting how good our teams have been both years until december happens. It's usually started by injuries too.
"Okay, well here's my response to people saying *""But Turkey is an NATO ally!""*: So?"
"True, but I meant he has no holiday themed skin from any of those events and all his skins (volsksya included) are pretty bland sadly..."
I'm so glad to hear that! Good luck rebuilding yourself.
Fox News attacked [NAME] for a fist bump. The absurd attacks were directed from the very top of conservative media.
And religion isn't displayed on uber page. She saw a brown person and refused to interact with them solely based on race. She's a racist.
That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
HEY EVERYBODY ITS TAGGED AS A SHITPOST STOP CARING THIS MUCH. OBVIOUSLY WE’RE NOT GETTING AD.
I don’t think [NAME] knocking us out of the copa would change anything. Our team is incredibly lethargic.
"Shit, I wish I had your skin and those blackheads. I’m 38 and still get acne and have scars!"
I scrolled past this and thought this was a title reveal and got so excited. Good GOOD theory though!
"Eh, loser. It’s sad how some people don’t care about their relatives."
Honestly it makes me sad but [NAME] does need less time:/
In shock and was more concerned about my kid tbh. Now off course I wish I'd sued the arse off her for emotional distress.
"My dads dislocated his twice. If it happens once, the knee is sometimes weakened which means it can happen again easily. "
"Your mental health. You might think its fine, but having to live a double / fake lifestyle is wearing on the best of us . "
Was that a thing? Please tell me this was not a thing.
When I think about [NAME] and [NAME] at the same time I get a fucking aneurysm from the stupidity.
"She's 17. Let her brag about cool visual effects, yikes"
"[NAME] is huge fucking liar, but you seem to like him."
that this ridiculous comparison is this detailed and explicit makes me think the whole beating-a-little-girl-thing is part of his disgusting sexual fantasies.
"It's more like ""Get tinder or any of the apps and get rejected hundreds of times a day"""
I reported an old man for terrible driving and the police actually took it seriously (pleasantly surprised). It's worth a try!
I could drive my fucking van through there!
"Definitely, I also get suspicious when someone tries to be my friend which doesn’t help"
"the game certainly feels unfinished, at least on PC. some horrible mouse controls, using a controller is almost necessary."
"Boy just tell her to ""calm down"" or ""watch her tone"" and get it over with."
Omg [NAME] he’s there because you don’t listen. You ass!
"Damn I was kinda counting on evolution to get me to heaven, but who am I to argue if [NAME] says it?"
"so lucky. im afraid to tell my [NAME] gf. :"")"
"Except for ""fighting liberalism"". Happy cake day."
This almost certainly should not have gone to OT. SEC refs are bad CBB refs are bad
Same people will complain of never seeing him except at election time
Again it's weed not heroin. Smoke it. Or sell it.
Now you go get his armor and do the same thing.
"Go for a walk with him. No phones allowed. Let him talk, share your experience. It hurts a little less every day."
"Post on the [NAME] and listen to info wars, you shouldn’t have an opinion on the Internet and you should not share it"
That’s so incredibly rude and inaccurate. You can’t actually believe that.
"If someone falsifies my medical records, I would say I've been harmed. "
All you need to read is [NAME] death near the end of the book to remind you... “Twas a comical effect.”
I'd feel better if the dude in the video didn't have a gun.
"Can confirm, playing a game of checkers is the one occasion I get to smash my wife"
"""Feed the wars and fuck the poors"" is pretty much their policy."
Sometimes I wonder if people are that stupid or that malicious
"Exactly, you have no clue whatsoever what you're talking about. I've never had an argument with a brainlet quite like this one, so kudos."
This is alternative facts level populism. The man is a liar.
"Confirmed that men are literally soulless, it's a matter until they start eating humans"
"they sounds like autistic meltdowns triggered by an immense fear of vomiting, nothing much to do"
Have you read /r/NEET ? You'll find that not all people hate being unemployed - they choose to be unemployed.
Worst deal on the leafs right now easily
This is the noise I make in my girlfriend’s ear while y’all are still scared to moan
"I'm glad the bears lost, but damn I feel so bad for [NAME]. The entire Chicago fan base will want him dead"
Even that game winning kick was close. Our kickers are cursed.
No problem. I'm happy to know it's not what you meant.
I'm sorry that happened. Was her hospice nurse aware that she was suffering?
Does anyone have a link to the rainbow song clip? I tried looking everywhere and can't find it :(
"Sorry to hear that, brother. Why do you feel more lonely now compared to usual?"
"[NAME] damn, that is the kind of biting commentary I enjoy."
I'm still so sad we never got to see [NAME] witnessing his miracle baby's first steps. ☹️
"I know, I know, but CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR BEING NERVOUS"
"I’d tell her nothing, that freaking weirdo would just never see my kid. The End. Disgusting."
"Serious question, where was this? That looks like my ex in the green top."
"Nah, I lied. I don't judge people's kinks and I like that [NAME] always moves me."
No I’m happy to spend big on myself. I’m not happy to spend my money on layabout benefits claimants.
Using high capital (money/picks) for 3 edge rushers would both be incredibly stupid *and* unjustifiable
Incorrect. I'll go with what [NAME] tells me thanks.
"Well, since everything in Australia wants to kill you, I'd say it is quite healthy to be afraid of Australian spiders, and other flora and fauna "
I knew a guy named [NAME]. Always wondered what his middle name was.
That just sounds like a show that would piss me off tbh
This is my fiancé and I hate it
To me the toenails is the grossest part! 🤮
They're wrong I don't like math and I'm still ugly
"How stupid are you, if you dont réalize it’s staged "
Have you read /r/NEET ? You'll find that not all people hate being unemployed - they choose to be unemployed.
How have you not seen this movie yet?
"It's absolutely 100% abuse, as others have said you need to get the hell away from him."
Glad she reads the comments of every [NAME] Facebook post ever
"We shot like 35 free throws, bud, we would've won by 16 if we made them all"
"no, educate yourself like an anarchist. "
"Holy crap, what happened to that guy?"
I'm not going to Photoshop that even as a joke because I know someone will find it out of context and take it seriously.
"I've got my sticker peeled off, nasty desperate notes left on the windshield, driver door.."
"It would probably be horrifying if we tried, when a bug causes an integer overflow and resets our aggression levels. "
Our soil needs the help! That would be a really unpleasant job.
"I like all of them, depending on what I want to learn. I really like [NAME] and [NAME] style, because they are such trolls. "
Haha you have a cut on your face you must be the worst person who ever lived.
"""No"" is the complete sentence I will use for this exercise."
"Because he's in dirt, and probably didn't have much practice "
/u/skyboundIan no spoilers in the trailer pretty please :D
"I have never seen [NAME] playing like this! (only started watching this season, not sure about last one)"
kind of funny considering that the fentanyl that is killing people in North America - Canada and USA - comes from China.
I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
"I can't stand [NAME]. Especially since her ""tatooing my own face"" video. "
"You fruitcart, you oughta be ashamed of knowing that, let alone expecting anyone else to know."
"> They are all one entity with the same goals. Agreed, sadly."
"Sir, you have been warned. You antagonistic attitude will not be tolerated. Please try harder at being a model citizen. Thank you for your cooperation."
Not guarantee. Only increased risk with time.
There is a surprisingly large number of [NAME] who play.
This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past “was” instead of “had been.”
I understand just so hard feels like I’m being thrown away like trash I don’t want to imagine a life without her in it
"Hey, come on! You did me twice! "
I’ve left my friends back at home. I know no one in this state.
"If they lightbulb doesn’t change then it’s racist, sexist, Nazi scum. Am democrat just playing along. "
"I love tropical weather, it's the endless ocean and moving ship (I have bad vertigo)."
"""Look, I know you want to teamfight right now, but jsut let me spend a little time in the jungle then we will win later"""
"You’re an animal, and you deserve all the shame/repercussions you get."
You're not the only one. I for one feel stupid for thinking 100t shouldnt be having problems with such an easy pool
Why is [NAME] still getting minutes? He is probably the worst player on this roster.
[NAME] is invaluable. Kawhi mama love him. Kawhi love him. His bow-legged ass is finally playing like NORMGOD again. He stay.
"Now that you're saying it, it actually makes sense. I'll be really hurt, but if she makes him happy I can't stop him."
My favorite part of women being in the game is fucking destroying them. Take that femenists
"No, that's not possible. If you have proof then it's not misinformation what your spreading but simply information. "
And yet you're still not making me regret being a TV hodad when that was on and so missing it.
"Nope, real serious disease affecting real people, including the person you first replied to."
That's forward heavy punch right? Sorry I'm pretty new to SF
"There’s a lot of us ladies here, unfortunately 😔"
It’s a shame really... ruining a perfectly good shirt like that
"People are gonna end up hating Deus Ex because of this, and that's just a travesty"
I see you utilized it. 3.5? Sad.
"I guess not, thanks for clearing it up mate"
Don’t spend time with someone who isn’t going to respect you as a person.
Yes. You fucking troll me every time. Fuck you.
Take this down my dude. This is cruel.
"Happy to not only have the same birthday as him, but to also have a ball he threw into the stands after the middle of the 9th inning. "
That's awful. But I am proud of you for calling him out.
The second half of the game was a big disappointment for me. I really wish they kept the family around for much longer.
"the trajectory of that is really weird! But [NAME], that guys arm, hand, possibly head is not liking the next .01 second!"
As a Florida girl I have no clue how you all have not died. I could never live there.
That's actually a really good one. Atleti fans also seem to love him and literally everyone who faces him despises him.
Every time one of our players enter top form they get injured.
Because it's so ridiculously stupid people just can't help themselves.
I went to your profile to see the other pics & saw your kitty. He's super cute!
"Even if you think me and him aren't soulmates, youve gotta be pretty sad to think soulmates don't exist. "
"Though I encourage! For an opportunity to play a game of such grand anticipation as this, is a sweet fortune."
"It will hurt, try to take your mind off things, and try to understand why it hurts"
"Comments like these are the biggest reason I get so pissed off about fucking centrists crying about the ""both sides"" argument. "
"Nah I get that, it's just AFFIRMATIVE action...unless this went over my head as well lol"
"It's rigor mortis but don't change it haha it's funny, good r/boneappletea material"
I’m not a fan of that hire at all... I’m also not a fan about how that all came out. All around bad.
I feel like I went out to get the pizzas and I came back to my apartment on fire.
Thought i was already there with the terrible title.
I remember hearing a story about this type of highway camaraderie once from a trucker who helped a woman escape a man... wonder if it was your mom
Why was this post removed? It wasn't even bad.
I guarantee you it is a huge concern to him. Never let up on the pressure against fascists.
I'd say that the vast majority of the population is and was rightly looked on as horrific. Christmas music makes me feel like a real [NAME].
Who would have thought people were going to be using the Padres for their fake news to generate clicks. This is nuts.
Im glad youre going to be a perfect parent who never makes any mistakes. Make sure you write a book!
Ay just like my life *whips whilst sobbing
you can tell she's insanely insecure by her body language and they way she poses for pics.
I am really intrigued why you worded the title this way.
Fucking happy this jerk is still well and alive.
"Man, I remember when we were utter pish. Those were not happy memories."
Somebody is really insecure about their career decisions.
I didn't know operation was a failure to be honest lol just knew what it was
He is better at public relations than the previous popes but he is basically just as bad when it comes to not punishing pedophiles
Seriously beautiful my man!! Is it on apple music? Really great song
"I like to answer ""CALLER 7, YOU ARE LIVE ON THE AIR!"""
I mostly shooed him away and didnt report him. But no one liked him. It was a short internship.
"Governments aren't generally considered ""monopolies"". You can't have two governments (at the same level). "
and everyone else is worried about themselves not paying attention to you
Lol that’s great. Grew up in north jersey and had the opposite experience
"It's barely a jumpscare tho, i dont get how this could be startling at all"
Oh yeah you would have definitely gone in to 'save' another country.
Homophobic?! I have FRIENDS who are xylophones!
We need to do something about [NAME] because he's fucking my fantasy team up
"Really takes ya by surprise anyway though, huh?"
Hooray! ...But I'll still never be able to afford a home.
But still incorrect usage of that subreddit. Shame! Shame!
Doesn't even make sense. You don't say dollars 5 so why put the dollar sign in front
"Not against us this season, apparently. "
2 is less user friendly but it can be fun. As long as you turn chat off. And hate yourself already.
Push me to the edge. All my friends are dead.
"Probably smashed his oil pan too, I'd give that car 3 miles to live."
Idk how to use any.... the 5th one looks scary
Sounds like a scene/moment ripped from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
If it was Central Transport you might of got lucky. Sometimes I wonder if they even hve doors on the trailers things go missing an awful lot
"Yes, because private matches are a thing. Surprised no one else has mentioned that one."
I remember a countdown for when the [NAME] twins turned 18 too. Thought it was pretty gross.
I’ve lived in Florida. Hurricanes are *much* worse.
No.. that's the exact opposite of what they are.
And this comes as no surprise too anyone
My [NAME] accuses me of cheating all the time too when I’ve been nothing but loyal. Makes me wonder if she was cheating on me too...
"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
Nope. I'd rather they fix their servers instead.
"You don't need to screw your face up like that, it's already screwed up enough."
Too obsessed. The only other author I read is [NAME]. Now I post on sports subs too
I don't find anything about women appealing.
"Sicko mode is on a whole new level, it cant be compared."
They’ll find out that I’m no goat. I’m the troll that eats the goats under the bridge.
Yes! Wonder how tall the girls will end up 😂
"Not me personally, but I do think it's an excellent idea. You never know when a stomach bug might hit."
"Lmao That’s a blatant lie, ~1000 people were killed by American cops last year compared to 52 cops killed by civilians "
I'm gonna say that I hate Randazzo's because of their terrible icing. Haydel's is decent and ships.
#**i have decided that i want to die**
I'm sorry your trust has been that badly broken.
I don’t think [NAME] knocking us out of the copa would change anything. Our team is incredibly lethargic.
An uproar would be an escalation of his behavior and if he starts stalking me in real life or making threats.
I talked to her family previous co workers and friends
Yes but as he has gotten bigger and older it has gotten so much worse.
Must be a tough life when all you can think about is sad stories to keep you from enjoying anything.
"I enjoy it as well, there's dozens of us!"
Liberals have become the very thing they accuse everyone else of. Being intolerant and racist.
Mr. Met is a legend! Outrageous. Now... If you wanna talk about hateworthy mascots... The Phanatic fits the bill.
"[NAME] also slept with his dads mistress, [NAME] is weird"
> don't tax anyone what a stupid idea.
And if you ever make a fat cop joke on reddit then you're the worst criminal of all!
Oh noooo. I once accidentally rubbed my eye after handling habaneros. It's the worst.
muh racist history! its all gone! no one will ever know about my slavery and being a traitorous vermin! help meh!
I don’t know where you live but in my area people don’t really care to have a good-faith conversation with an anarchist.
"Why delete it. It's relatable, never be shamed of what you're going through. "
Horrible how they just invade your space anytime any place.
"Considering my wife barely touches me, I think I could get this job. Wonder how much it pays. "
"What the fuck? Really? That’s horrible. That’s probably illegal. If it isn’t, it should be."
Yet here you are mad about [NAME] being apathetic.
Noo this guy was parachuting down fromthe mount blanc to kill his self
They are both good in their own way. But the us is funnier lol
"Disgusting, I bet you he will never even be inside that apartment condo ever."
"I literally, like, hate people like that."
Ahhh. A civil and interesting conversation on the internet. How refreshing.
She does NOT love you. Try to ask yourself why you are accepting this treatment.
Someone made a similar joke and got 500 down votes.
👍 excellent! I was wondering if anyone else knew this little known nugget from history.
I should've left after the first period ended. That was brutal.
I solo climbed to Master as main DPS with 60hz. It really doesnt matter.
Not [NAME]. He really didn’t seem like the Canuck players that played with him missed him at all.
I’ve lived in Florida. Hurricanes are *much* worse.
Exactly. It just shows they can't make a good argument.
God. Damnit. Ever since HS hockey players have been my fetish... This is almost too much...
"Same for me, feels like i've been made alone just so my brother can get all the attention"
Hating people for what they've done VS Hating people for their race. Even you have to be able to see the difference.
I was my father's 4th girl. **Nothing** made him uncomfortable by that point
muh racist history! its all gone! no one will ever know about my slavery and being a traitorous vermin! help meh!
"I think it's the pass rush and that nobody can stay healthy and, but it could be [NAME]. He's not the greatest"
LOL at this question! If he follows the sub...just read the topics for opinions! I call BS!
"Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad."
Oh. My. [NAME]. I can’t handle this
"Thats just dumb, u are stealing from people that just want to live a good life cuz other were unlucky, they were also unlucky by being born."
well.. didn't have it when I was a kids but I like it now when it's served as side dish at beer bars.
"Very little people care, also just because other countries have it is not a reason "
Being so gullible is the frightening part. durr da durr he downvote me
Ah geez what a disaster if she tries this!
"It was like fifteen minutes old, I doubt that many individual people cared to click in the first place. Also different account names kept responding."
"Thimerosal isn't even in vaccines anymore, due to the controversy. "
Actually that's the wrong guy. The guy you're thinking of is in prison now facing life. This guy sucks just as bad though..
Fuuuuck. I feel this. In my core.
Lol maybe he is not but I think my point still stands 😄
"you did drug her though, and assault her by undressing her and taking her photo. you committed multiple crimes. you need professional help."
sounds so good bro! but in my case i’m already out so it feels like it would be a burden to re-coming out... TvT
"Its kinda odd,how theres always kinda a war between ""Party music"" and ""Feelings Music"""
I am really sad because my innocent nieces are brainwashed by my crazy sister
That isn't really true if you've watch all Arsenal games this season.
Wasn't expecting these feels man. I'm so sorry for your loss!
Merrily merrily merrily merrily something something scream... (I am not creative)
"One time at the moment, but I did feel so full of energy after."
"This post made me howl in laughter in the handicapped bathroom, thank you /u/coffeewhore17"
Ha ha ha. That was a good one
My mum had this. I got to pick things I wanted from inside and we’d make them together. :) nice memories.
[NAME] just wants to post pics of her facetuned of herself for attention while acting morally superior to those other girls. fuck off
I'm not attacking you. Which part of our conversation gives the impression that I'm attacking you? Honest question.
[NAME] expunged my paraphernalia without consent and I called the **LAW TIGERS** to sue him for damages.
The last message was particularly painful to read
Yeah I don’t think [NAME] wants you to fuck my wife/his girlfriend anymore you cuck
Scary that [NAME] ASG effort looked similar to some of his regular season performances.
"The problem is your husband. If he prioritized you, he would have figured something out. I’m so sorry."
Scotland aren’t the best team to compare against. On their day the could debatably beat NZ on a bad day they lose to America
"It's creepy but also sad that the guy was bathing in your fountain, hey at least it wasn't your pool. "
Last email i got was on Jan 27th on Sunday @11:22PM which is really odd imo
Huh. So it really comes down to looking at her senate career vs her AG career.
"Great story. Maybe it isn't malicious compliance, but I enjoyed it anyway. Damn companies who lack empathy for other humans."
"Till Valhalla brother, you will be missed. "
One of my favorite films. I got to see a screening with a live soundtrack conducted by [NAME]. There were tears in my eyes!
Saying that men have it more difficult in certain scenarios doesn't mean that men have it easier than women in all circumstances. That's ridiculous.
Ice Cream or Tacos for me. Or the best of both worlds.... a ChocoTaco!
"Wait, apple and [NAME]? Please tell me these fools are all on windows phones "
"U damn clown, she prolly felt so embarrassed and you’re just like meh"
oh my [NAME]. it was hurting my brain. i only saw the disappearing boot and thought i was missing something.
I honestly have no clue but I’d also love to have one of those
He's eating cheese and watching football in the sky now. Rest in peace!
I am interested if still available. This would be way more fun then my smith center season!
Of course. Just know that I know that you know you're a liar.
[NAME] is already gone and he knows it. No way he’s re-elected.
I started the Kitty City Meowboys and I do those things. I have a mic but I don't use it because talking exhausts me
That has gotten me killed a few times lately.
Good job being just generally being whiny about unimportant things
Is it wrong that I've been really disappointed that I haven't gotten to try out my new snowblower? :-/
Reading this made me happy and I don't even know you. Keep doing your thing!🙌🏼
Hulu is awful for this. The volume on their commercials is deafening.
"The weird part of our ""rivalry"" is that some people bought into it."
"It’s my favorite Saturday movie, never gets boring"
"""Sad"" but ""true"" There you go I fixed it for you."
Also it’s YOU’RE a fucking stupid moron. Thank u.
The worst thing about this tweet is how many likes and retweets it got
Woah up until this comment I thought the same
"I'm very sorry for u, they should treat you like royalty not a fleshlight"
"No problem here, as long as neither one of you are the asshole."
If there is no goal on this powerplay it will be difficult not to be hopeless
"It's not his fault, it's your wife's. Shes the one you need to be pissed at"
"It's the best, I haven't been so happy in a long time!"
I never said prostitution doesn't exist. I said it is off the streets.
Can we get a moment of silence for the passing of the video game boy?
"Wow, really? I hope this kind of event doesn’t happen that often. "
"As horrible as it is to say, evidently the voting population doesn't care enough to make a large impact. "
"> If everyone is put on the same level, where’s the competition? That's not what communism is.."
I’m actually suprised they all didn’t follow him and now they all have to repeat junior year.
I’m not high and that sounds like a good sandwich.
> For the same reason it wouldn’t permit business with an expressly racist/sexist/etc. business But those practices are illegal at all levels already.
Sometimes we pick the bad option to make a point.
1200? I thought it was 12000! Ohhhhhhh. Dr. Now’s not going to be too happy with my weigh-in dis munt.
"Nope, real serious disease affecting real people, including the person you first replied to."
He already sucks. Let’s just nerf him some more.
Monero enthusiast here. Make me happy and call me a liar again.
I don't get it :( + Idk which game u guys talking about :(
"Science is measuring what we see. I also notice that you didn't respond to anything else I said, which tells me that you've got nothing."
"Holy crap, I've never seen a picture of [NAME] so thin."
"It's not you, Taco Bell is grade D racoon meat and isn't fit for human consumption."
"Amen! However, see my post about the problem with drafting [NAME]. If we do, [NAME] will probably be the odd man out."
I’d crap myself if that happened to me.
I hate [NAME] and [NAME] for what they've done to this franchise. And I'm growing to hate [NAME] as well.
"We don't undervalue him, almost any and all experts thing he is just not worth his contract."
Hate to see him go. The only thing I’m complaining about besides this was the hagelin trade back in November. Both hit home
[NAME] supporters don’t see it as offensive.
I don't think they really learn so much as they relax and get more comfortable.
I like how he wrote many of the TRUE [NAME]. I wonder what a fake [NAME] believes in.
People really spend more than $10 in an app game? I mean an actual video game I can understand but that's just...sad
"Worst bit is that it keeps snowballing, and growing and suddenly it this mess you can't make sense out of or clear up"
I'm paranoid that I might not have all of them. A download would be helpful!
Whoa I actually remember this. Wait shit does that mean I’m old
"True! Remember the geocentric universe? Oh man, they even put [NAME] in jail. What a hoot!"
"It's funny cause you say socialists have an ""ignorance of economics"" while posting on an anarcho-capitalist sub :) I think you clearly fundamentally misunderstand socialism. "
I’m wondering the same; something seems weird about that interpretation of the law
NO I HAVE NOT EVER FIRED MY GUN IN THE AIR AND GONE AAAAGGHHH!
I'm 25 and I still don't have a license. I'm terrified of driving and get anxiety every time I'm behind the wheel.
"roll a blunt, walk over and strike a conversation.... or mind your fcking business"
"Tyl has got to be the most cringey, condescending thing I've seen on Reddit in a while."
"This is like the third repost of this. But yes, very sad indeed."
A fatass? Look at him. You think he cares about his appearance? He’s likely talking about alcohol anyway.
Was less worried about spelling and more worried about warning everyone in the match
"Wow, /r/noisygifs for real. First time I genuinely felt I could hear it."
"That's why everyone loves you, you're a joke club. "
One of the very few individuals to survive a shot to the head. Very unfortunate since he had a couple of more good years ahead of him.
And that's an issue. Councils are *so* unrepresentative it hurts.
OMG my [NAME] hates it too but she does it to me all the time
"Civ VI has a lot more interesting concepts, but overall it's still a kinda boring game. Then again, I think the same of Civ V."
I like Derek. It's on Netflix and I was crying my eyes out and laughing hysterically every single episode. I was sorry they cancelled it.
Disinfected or sanitized maybe. No way an entire exam table is sterilized.
"Some people just need reassurance that they are, in fact, dumb. "
"Problem is, it is Bantam and younger. I can teach breakouts easy enough and I don't need a panicked D zone to do it."
"Oh, I've thought about it... a lot, but I just couldnt do that. Even though he really deserves it!"
That's the reason I am terrified to wear contacts on duty. I'm afraid it'll get stuck between my contacts and eyes and destroy my pupils.
"No its not, i dont care what (((they))) say"
At least he didn't throw them at someone.
Pleased to meet you. Hope you guess my name.

You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
I'll be shocked if humanity makes it to 2100. But yeah. It's a miracle I'm alive since I had the toe on the trigger.

"That sounds really agonising, to ask for help and have no one hear you. What's going on for you right now?"
Spending your handouts and having some taken back doesn’t in any way make you a contributor.

Sorry dude. I’m pretty new here. Wasn’t sure I had to do that. My bad. 😢
That's really creepy. What is crazy is that 9 year old's get cell phones now! Times have certainly changed :p.
Same with [NAME]. I was even disappointed Parks and Rec had newt gingrich on for a cameo.

This guy is desperate to be a victim everyone. We can't fix him.
This is doubtful...he just won with over 50 percent
It was when oil prices were higher. It’s primary export is petrol and the market slumping is hurting

No. Going to a competitive high school was harder and more stressful than all my adult endeavors combined.
That is not the reason we do not want to leave the CU. Try again.
"Binge drinking is a big problem in VN right now, unfortunately. So I wouldn't be surprised if drunkenness was the main cause of this. "

Same here. It’s very hard. I really feel for you.
God [NAME] can't come back fast enough. I don't know if the fans in the rest of the league realize how big his loss is
Thanks so much for taking the initiative to do this! Not all heroes wear capes :)
"You’re absolutely right, I’m 61 and shouldn’t be at all surprised by the arrogance that ignorance can generate."
I’m in my second year. Still closeted. Still uncomfortable with my body and sexuality. Still socially awkward.
Oh god. Imagine losing to Toronto in the cup final. You would spent the rest of your life hearing about it

Typically the speeches come from a functional adult. The Idiot is an unindicted co-conspirator with a visible personality disorder. Feigning normalcy is part of what's wrong.

Well I am happy you believe that.

What’s the issue with [NAME]? I think he’s been good off the bench this season .
I have a bad feeling about this.
Congrats on catching up to much of the developed world.
The fact someone could read your post and literally go and do this saddens me.
I wonder what a hug would feel like a lot too.
Three year olds learn it's wrong to draw on the walls with crayon. I think you look stupid in this thread.

"Meh, same branch of religion. Just opposing views on the sequel to the story."
This was a year where late breakers broke towards [NAME]. Whereas late breakers broke towards [NAME] in 2016. That explains how she did so well.
I keep being drawn to her privates because it looks so strange to me.

His video is definitely against the rules.. He literally asks people to spam oh yeah yeah everywhere
A mix of useful idiots and active grifters. It's a sad sign of our culture that these people make a living this way.

One of the more disgusting virtue signals I've seen

omg that's gonna be a hell of a reunion as well
"ah thats my bad, she just finished the blog and im sharing it around, one sec and ill edit it. "
"The baby photos, holy fucking shit there's so many baby photos now."
That’s Grandpa [NAME]. I stomp flaming bags with my boots
"I'll think about prime, just heard a lot of negative about them that spooks me some."
If those people abandoned you for sharing how you feel then they are not your friends
"I'm sorry, but this has also caught my attention and I kinda want to see this screenplay."
"Nope, no deal far more likely to starve the country than U-boat blockade."
These comments are in stark contrast to the more level-headed ones in r/news. Wonder why?
What’s the clip from? I’m scared to put “teen boy good kisser 900 number” into YouTube
This gets posted a lot. It’s not really that great. Interesting concept - the first hour had my interest - goes downhill the second half.
Haha and [NAME] is calling the Chicago crew the most triggered bunch. Then proceeds to scream at them like the little triggered bitch he is.
Because our roster has gotten worse each year since 2017 and the team is spending less. That isn't a recipe for continued success
"Didnt work for me, but thanks 🙆"
"YAAAS! Even though you're a stranger on the internet, this has made my day."
Arguing a player is the GOAT among every position is just a dumb argument to even begin with when it comes to football.
They would call him a snowflake libcuck
"Blade and Soul looks terrible, IMO. Way way way too much saturation and bloom. Great post, OP!"
"I saw the one where he was successful, and wondered how many attempts it took. "
"False, if I'm close to the cart return I can't run and ride the cart back to the return. Lol"
The “targets” so far has been guilty.
Watch [NAME] left arm and hand as he's on the floor. Scary.
This is incorrect. Taiwan was regarded as an island of no importance.
I used to do the same exact thing! Now I love the fat on my steak and watching them cut it off in japanese restaurants makes me sad.
Cant you just feel the unconditional love <3
I was eating watching tonight's episode. OMG I never will again. You all know what I mean. The opening scene!!!
stepping on the beach *dodo doot doot doo* > stepping in water > stepping on legos
The ID cards wouldn't have been a problem if they were like the EU one. It was the fuckload of biometric data that was abhorrent.
"I mean if he’s into it, sure, whatever. I’m not one to judge. "
enjoy it and happy New Year!! I was at the cheesecake factory yesterday with one of my kids.. had a blast
Because sometimes the middle is still wrong
Why the fuck do people have these conversations in public
i’m so glad you’re doing good now! have a great new year and keep pushing on my guy!
I meant I wouldn't bring up wanting it to be vanilla and changing terms.
"It's good to see that the rich are being cured of this. :) As for the poor, we can just burn them for fuel."
Nahhh just as they came to me
"Me too! And he was so happy to get that out of her back, he seems like he really cares."
Yeah because a country can't multitask. Go pedal your propaganda elsewhere
His sentences don’t contradict. You just have poor comprehension.
> I thought he didn't actually collect the second He lost the second imo.
I'm paranoid that I might not have all of them. A download would be helpful!
"How the hell is that comment ""holding the GM accountable"""
Nah [NAME] gonna be an asexual for sure.
Agree. I did enjoy Godless but I was addicted to The Terror. It was full of such amazing character actors.
"Im sorry that I'm only able to give a single upvote for this wonderful, graphic, and accurate visualization."
Just do it. Straight up ask if he wants to date in clear terms. If he doesn't no reason you can't stay friends.
I dont think anyone liked 6A apart from the two Slade episodes and the crossover. Most people here consider it to be sloppy
"“Guys watch out, the scary looking kid is coming down the hall”"
A couple things: Fuck Nazism. Enjoy the ban for trolling!
"I don't know why he'd take it like that, he was gone for so long so someone was going to do a show like that."
That was a terrible pass regardless. Wasn’t close
Truth Yeah keep living in your reality lol Delusional idiot
Its a weird thing they do south of the border... they throw flour at each other. No idea why that's a thing.
It is January after all. The yard in my house is looking horrific right now - I haven't been out in 4 months!
He does kinda suck IMO Doesn’t mean Venezuela should be coup’d by the US
Overhead fans are absolute shit. They literally do nothing but blow dust around.
A UBI has to be sustainable. Taxing something to reduce its use and funneling that money into something people would depend on is absolute stupidity.
>Israel is literally an apartheid state It's literally not and the proliferation of that accusation is based on ignorance and simplistic understanding.
They added it back for a short time but removed it shortly after.
Agree with everything here. Going to med school abroad will always put you at a disadvantage if you want to practice in the states
"Ok, then what the actual fuck is your plan?"
It infuriates me how many layers of tape these things have sometimes.
[NAME] still got a little pop tho for calling for the match. Makes me smile that the crowd still loves her.
You ladies are awesome. Thank you all so much for your kind words.
"Excelerate are looking really good yo. They've outslayed every map, are executing perfect plays. Fun, playing to their full potential."
Isn’t /politicalhumor a sub that barely has any real activity though...?
You have no recourse. You can always start your own fb group if you'd like.
The mouthbreathers usually aren't boys but guys between 2-3 times my age. Possibly homeless and very smelly.
No! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans lol
you guys got hate in your heart
"Only when I started to suspect I was shadow banned, so like a couple days ago. Apart from that no."
A complete lack of self-reflection is a prerequisite for being a [NAME] supporter.
"I never understood the part where he dives into a pile of money, even as a child. It seems wildly painful."
I'm guessing that insurance to cover the liability is a big part of it. It sure as hell isn't going to the wages of the employees.
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU’RE TALKIN’ TO ME!
"Damn dude, can’t believe I never considered this possibility."
And the amount of crops we eat is destroying river systems and forests. Not to mention the animals killed inadvertently during harvest.
Because this creep wanted to put his hands on the girl.
"For you, the day the bison frolicked in the snow was the cutest time in your life, but for me...it was Tuesday. "
"I like flirting so this is what I enjoy doing, plus ordinary flirting is outcome independent. Direct approach is outcome dependent. Either way it's all part of the fun!"
It doesn’t surprise me given that this is the kind of establishment where staff rape the coma patients.
I’m glad not too much time was put into this
"Fleur is already a French word, adding the la isn't really frenching it up fyi It's changing ""flower"" to ""the flower"" :)"
Why should I get flayed? He's the one who sucks!
> fooled into believing herself an interesting character Uh.. that isn't how movies work.
Actually my biggest question is why people are working if they aren't getting paid
Being born in north america is a curse my friend. Oregon (my home) is kind of like Ireland weather wise though I hear.
"Yeah, they are the dumb ones you need to avoid."
I hate that we cant be trusted to self criticize and we have to have Russian news do it. It feels like watching fox.
Oh I will be independent. I don't need someone like that in my life.
Thank you for your advice! I couldn’t agree more.
"If they were that good, she wouldn't have burned through 3 pairs in 3 years. "
"Yeah I think he was joking though. Like a cynical, sarcastic sorta comment"
Yes! I was lost without subtitles on Sons of Anarchy.
SHE DESERVES TO BE TRULY HAPPY. LEAVE HER [NAME].
"Normally don't like telling people the value of their opinion, but this opinion... Is 100% correct carry on "
Thats true. Those kinds of drinks can give you a heart attack.
"Damn, I thought she was calling her as ugly as a dog and said she would take her out for a walk. I like my version better. "
American democracy is weak but it's not dead. If the intention of your comment was to discourage people from voting then you are the problem.
FUCK TAMPA. FUCK TORONTO. WE WINNING THE MOTHERFUCKING CUP
Doesn't help that it's not actually cheese. Looks like a pretty standard Vegan mac+whatever you wanna call it
That kinda happened to me at a chillibees once. I semi full on panicked. I grew to hate that place. And booths.
I can't not pick Savor the Flavor when playing Stitches though. It's just too damn fun.
"While I understand where you are coming from, this is a tad too aggressive."
"No, you're supposed to get angry and yell that you're right when someone corrects you"
Those are some pissed off lookin Nucks
You obviously have never seen those creepy videos with 10m+ views with kids. And those Elsagate videos.
"That's horrible, good to know she is with an awesome guy."
"Thank you. We're as messed up and fallible as any other set of parents, but we're trying to learn from our mistakes."
It's got home made bread pudding so therefore the rest has to be good!
"""Yeah look"" like a toddler being surprised by his own genitals"
No kids? Who cares. Go your separate ways.
We're going to return to [NAME] and [NAME] being bffs again and talking shit about [NAME] or some other random shit.
It must suck to be so boring that all you can talk about is an expensive watch
This made me smile so hard. I am happy for you. May we all find our own happy and worthy constellations 💕
How is it racist? I fail to see how.
Until the downvotes roll in and you become glue :(
"Omg, there is a wallet made out of a dead squirrel on that sub! *SUBSCRIBED*"
i can imagine going to a job interview and the one of the committee just immidiately shouting *Audentes Fortuna Iuvat!*
She's aggressive in every TLJ fight. She even bullied that poor homeless man.
"I love [NAME], but this sounds like he’s claiming signing a 26 year old superstar is stupid. Come on."
I know a dozen local school administrators. What the hell are you talking about?
Oh my [NAME] I forgot about that movie
that's why im here in the overwatch university subreddit you fucking idiot.
That was my first live Lions game (British and flights to DTW are expensive) I've never gone through so emotions in such a short amount of time
I'm also a human being but I can't think of any reason why I would physically hurt a woman.
man this gif is weird both directions
Sorry for the stupid question but what's the Overton window? Still new to politics/jargon.
The absolute subhuman filth that worships [NAME] will believe that this isn't even a photoshop
If theyre real pharma then id charge $7 or 8 a pill. I never pay more than 5 for real ones but $8 is still kinda fair
And that's not [NAME] either. It's former HS o-lineman who now runs a frat
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** melodesign! ^(hug)
That’s always my worst fear when the idea of leaving during January comes up. I wish you the best of luck in unthawing them!
"Hate the taste, switched to a plastic nalgene bottle"
The only thing wrong with her is her face. Maybe she has a giving personality?
For me it is unwatchable after the greatness of the LD seasons.
Woah nice. Did you enjoy it or was it a completionist pain? I wish I could get into [NAME] but I just dont find the fun.
"Most of us think it’s just a conditioning thing right now, but we don’t really know"
TYT is a gossip shitpost panel for race baiting idiots. By race baiting idiots.
My parents are going to kill me when they find out.
"I can take the Karma loss, I couldn't help but troll that other post a bit. Some will get it (like yourself)."
"You know damn well they'd say ""Narudo"" and ""Assault on Titan 13"""
"Wow, you must've never been on /pol/ or like dozens of anti [NAME] subreddits."
"Its an mlm in disguise, branded to appeal to the college demographic. I got the fuck out "
"You choose a bad time, no one is fessing up anything during an election."
Don’t explain how you’re feeling to her either. Women like men who’s feelings are unclear.
This comment killed me. RIP in pieces.
The fact that this being brought up makes it a real scary feeling.
"I don't know why, but the thought of that hat on smoke makes me smile..."
Problem is as soon as someone criticises Israel they jump up and down and scream anti semitism
"This is so hard to sit through, I can't believe the swearing from this dood, it makes it all the more unbearable"
What's your point? All these comments are from people who clearly had not seen it before. Only a couple said they had.
This is blatant racism and harassment of minors. These people need to be fired.
Fair enough. I'm probably thinking of someone who still has some semblance of shame.
"Got out in only 20, huh? [NAME]. "
And none of them give a damn about the [NAME]. Very telling.
I cant think of anything funny to say so upvote to give me free karma
You look like a bear.... An ugly cartoon bear
they are going to need a gardener soon!!
Not really. Relying on someone you can't trust is bad. Sometimes relying on someone is the only happiness you'll get.
This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.
"It sounds like you’re enzyme deficient, I’ve never heard of someone becoming sensitive to a drug from using it "
Been their. We got into a huge argument and that caused our first break up. Video games...
"I play those characters all of the time and have never, ever experienced this. "
Can't help but feel that going down 3-0 is nerves and fear of playing someone with [NAME] mythology. AO to [NAME] is like RG to [NAME]
Nah mate i think you have me mixed up with someone else. I am [NAME]. Pleased to meet you.
"gotchu lol, in that case sorry you got downvoted to hell for this lol"
"She wasn’t seeking asylum in Thailand though, she was just trying to pass through to Australia, where she already had a visa iirc. "
How sad that you think because [NAME] wants something we should no longer want it. Grow up you child. Life does not revolve around you or [NAME].
"It was a terrible, terrible thing to do. He did every day of his time for it, has expressed regret, and has not repeated it."
**I can't believe she held out for a full 24 hours before flip-flopping**
I'm generally a supporter of law enforcement.... But what the actual fuck.
I'd be happy with a Goff win too. And you can't hate Brees. Rams vs. Chargers would be perfect. final score 72-70.
Surely you dont think its the bravest thing a person can do though right?
I know Bro! Won't happen again next Jan-uary.
"Please be [NAME]. I like [NAME], for the record. But I'm def willing to part ways with him. "
Saw plenty. That is how to be a jerk to a cat. It will enforce bad behavior.
Nice! I'm glad there was a great turnout. Congrats!
There’s this which is terrifying to think about
"if only we could blast this type of stuff out there for everyone to hear, then we might just get get those neo libs to the realization."
I would vote no to a United Ireland because the Republic doesn't have a free health service and no free prescriptions
"Honestly, I wouldn’t want to poop without my phone either. Gotta scroll reddit while I’m poopin!"
The reaction was contained under the bandaid due to big pharma’s nanobot technology to help disguise the TRUTH. :P
They were talking about what they should call the 'not Constantinople' release in the meeting- its a crime that nobody thought of this.
He was aggrieved that people didn’t recognize him and recognized steroid users instead.
It still hurts 15 years later. I don't know how people can be so callous their own child
Lol. My gamer tag is the same as on here if you ever want to squad up and play man
I hope you figure out what to do! It is real shit situation and it is awful what he said to you.
"The foul, smelly dump I just took > fallout 76"

"I find it hard to say ""no"" to anyone, but I knew if I didn't, he would have done exactly what you said. "
Try wearing something unattractive when that student is around.
Being alone isn't the problem. Being **forever** alone is the problem.
"No clue, all I know is that Shia [NAME] hit themselves for some reason "
Just what I need; a video of my commute to work so I can enjoy the experience in my free time.

"While I love the brutality of Odyssey, my personal favorites were from Black Flag. "

As a Dolphins fan this hurts me
"The best feeling ever was when class was over and it never got to your turn, so you didnt have to present until the next day"
You are delusional if you think big oil and existing deeply entrenched and rich traditional energy can’t pay scientists more money than new renewable energy can.
1200? I thought it was 12000! Ohhhhhhh. Dr. Now’s not going to be too happy with my weigh-in dis munt.
"haha, she doesn't support me for whatever reason. lol you got problems bro. open your ears and shut your mouth"
I like it so far I’d heard of it ages ago just never got round to watching it.
That's not what he meant. He means the use of a lot of different hashtags.
"Me and friends just got Vermintide 2, and it isn't an MMO but it solves a lot of MMO problems we had. Quite fun so far."
From one eating disorder to another. That's not recovery that's just sad.
"Agreed. Personally I don’t understand meeting up for just sex, but I still don’t judge those who do it. "
"Hahaha! Omg, that’s so funny. Thanks for taking one for the team. I heard it was bad but not that bad. "
"So, that's super illegal in the U.S. And a cooler is not worth slicing someone's finger tips open. "
Thins are my favorite and I will not apologize. It makes the flavor of the cookie shine through.
No group... I didn't say the guy's plan was realistic haha
If you don't think MAGA hats are associated with racism then you've got your head stuck in the sand.
This is my fiancé and I hate it
You get a lot more freedom and free time. College is a blast
"Lol, I’m surprised more people didn’t catch that. Thanks for the med check! "
It is. I bet chantex and all the other 'quit smoking' companies hope this book doesn't become too popular. That would cut into their profits.
"If you know it's the right thing to do, it's better to ""lose"" that person than to ""lose"" that opportunity."
Oh [NAME] it's [NAME] against dinosaurs again
"It's ""snowflake"" to get upset over something like this 😂😂😂"

I'm so surprised they haven't done it yet tbh!
You're the biggest sack of shit to post here in some time.
Not unexpected this election was gonna be a brawl between him and [NAME] from the start.
My liver CRIES watching these kids. Weeps into a warm cup of steamed milk.
I had no idea! The art style just seemed similar to me. Looks like I’ve got a new show to watch.
"Amazing that Aunt [NAME] wouldn't genuinely reflect on her her behavior, or realize that she is raising a spoiled, rude child."
My mom used to throw tantrums in public. I wanted to crawl into a hole and die when she'd start.
Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.
That has gotten me killed a few times lately.
PayPal is fucking pricey. 500 bucks to Mexico cost me 60$

You're never too young to have a Vietnam flashback
Here come the angry [NAME] stans 🤪🌹
Signing a 31yr old injury prone player for 5 years 60mil is pretty stupid. [NAME] would have been similar cost wise and he isn't made of glass
AND THEY ARE REALLY ANNOYING WE MADE FIRST CONTACT 30 YEARS AGO AND THEY'RE STILL SENDING US TERRIBLE MINION MEMES
The Netflix documentary about [NAME] absolutely sucks. Don't waste your time.
"I'm guessing ""Corporate Stooge"" didn't focus group well."
"What scares me is that now that this happened, they're going to try and find ways to take women's phones away from them."
I do that too. I just feel oddly uncomfortable when I'm doing a task and there's no noise in the background.
I feel like that’s not the best spot for a beach
I shouldn't be tanking this much rating after even a year bro. You don't understand how bad it feels to be in this garbage elo.

Don't you even dare try to put any blame on [NAME]
"I agree with you, but you know, sharia *is* sharia, which I find a tad more frightening "
Definitely fake. Looks like bad CGI in a movie.
I wouldn't say everyone's fanatical about not paying tax it just sometimes throws you off if you don't remember about it.
Geezus... it’s like I was reading a biography someone wrote about me before getting divorced.
Her communications director his now working for [NAME]. Get ready for some more cringe
So you have your twin 6'9 215 pound forwards playing different positions? Interesting gm'ing. I see why the Hornets are so terrible.

I think this title is biased. It groups all media improperly.
Also the least satisfying answer but probably true haha
Another sick burn! You're fun when you're wrong.
What does it matter we're just going to take another bust in the middle of the first round like always

"To each according to their needs... Except entitled parents, who need everything."
"Wow, the interview with her mom really made that clip."

Nope. No joke. Also happy cake day

[NAME] and the Chicago Wolves (I'm so sorry)

My cockatiel is sitting on my knee. I gave him a hug and promised no more pets.

"The TV anime series is, at least, atrociously bad and stupid. Is full of deus ex and silly cliffhangers."
"Important part of this, surprising it's not there. "
Huh? Mutts are usually healthier than pure-breds. It's the pure-bred dogs that have weird genetic issues.

"That's too much meta for me to follow, pls explain."
Liberals have become the very thing they accuse everyone else of. Being intolerant and racist.

"[NAME]*, and do you expect them to get fired literally in the middle of the season? "
He starts mildly enough with a pucker... then when she *backs away* he opens his mouth and goes further. Seriously - what kind of idiot is that guy?
The Remini series. I love it. Horrifying and karma and righteous indignation.
Except it destroyed 76% of America's scooby snack production. May Shagster have mercy on us all.

One of the most posted things on reddit. Please delete
This seemed so out of character but I was like cool. Weird.
Truly a sad day when you can get fired just for having a *heated gaming moment*. We really do live in a society.

"[NAME], [NAME], [NAME], prime [NAME] + [NAME] was fun. "
That was.. very confusing and entirely unhelpful? I read it three times and got nothing from this.
Exactly! Someone think of the billionaires! Sometimes I pretend I’m one and it’s really fun :)
"So, so many hugs and high fives! You are an awesome momma. "
I'd make that trade and I don't even like big macs.
Sure. The subject of her video was certainly creepy and obnoxious.
"Good catch. I guess I was just remembering the shift after the first debate. That's pretty sad, tbh. "
That trade turned out to be a complete disaster for us. Too bad.
This stresses me out way too much.

Yes! It's hard to believe that some people like warm toilet seats enough to pay for it as a feature.
"And best of all, it is giving a child a loving home."
I can’t wait until they start coloring in between the lines all the way up to their noses.
i luckily became really good friends with one. we definitely helped each other process our pain from him... so surreal how well they spin those lies
And yet still just outside of the playoffs and not the worst team in the last 10 games.
Yeah [NAME] is actually really cute and nice but best boi and best girl goes to [NAME] and [NAME]. Just kidding. [NAME] all the way
I sure hope so. I wanna cry tears of joy knowing [NAME] and [NAME] rode off into the sunset with one last ring.

"I love them, it's so fun to jump around everywhere"
I'm actually amazed we walked away with 2 points. That 2nd was one of the worst periods I've watched. [NAME] stole that period.
Don't you know? We have to just shut up and put our heads down until they decide!
A volley into a header. Just wow. The skills.
I dislike the shade he’s been throwing to our franchise and his inability to take responsibility for the reasons why he was traded
Even more so. It would only make our prison (this world) even more diabolical.
His whole point is that he doesn't have to give a damn about others or how they feel.
Excuse me who the hell is that?
I think this does help less good pupils to learn it better and agree with the teachers. In my class thats the biggest problem when it comes to french
this is less tabletop horror more... regular horror do you know how he's doing now?
Ouch. That hurt the ego. And that’s not easy to do.
Must be a tough life when all you can think about is sad stories to keep you from enjoying anything.
I'm from Lebanon and have been supporting Celtic since 2006 ! Glad to see there are other people from around the world here !
Oh look a player breaking out of a slump against Dallas. Haven't seen this one before

>Rise of Agon Literally the worst fucking game that man kind has ever managed to accomplish and you call him a carebear? Fuck out of here.
Wait wait wait... did [NAME] go 61-27??
This interview has so much gold in it. The Wreck it Ralph bit is my favourite.
"Oh, it’s only made them more determined to invent the “creepy [NAME]” narrative themselves."
Also stay hydrated! That was a mistake I was constantly making too
"I hope she lives to be 200, just to piss them off."
[NAME] is hot garbage on that court. He has been the biggest disappointment of any player this season.
Damn this sounds like a former friend of mine. She doesn’t get instant validation on things and flips out. Cut negative people out OP.
"Guilty Gear actually did that before with Guilty Gear Isuka. It was, uh...not good. Really fuck-awful, actually. "
Which was in 2017. Enjoy your loss and shush. You'd think having 1 win in a month would humble you...
"This is most excellent news! Also, glad to know he went on to work somewhere like Google."
People keep giving serious arguments but you keep replying “but mah happiness” Not worth it to lose time arguing with the likes of you
It is hard to make up the new relevant points at times.... Revolution they say
No it doesn't work like that you're wrong
"These are all problems you're creating for yourself, not something she's doing."

True i hate going to parties or concerts but love going to a bar or a houseparty.
"Me too! I don't believe in likes or karma points, but I know other people care and it might be the highlight of their day."
Ok so how do I put money on this? Because I do not see Mac shelling out the goods to make that happen

Are you one of them? Sorry. You asked for it. 😂

Afraid not. I was just given a different perspective.
"Oh god, never thought of the implications of [NAME] not selling BB-8 as mirroring her parents giving her up. That tugs the heartstrings a little bit."
I came here to tell you that this wins this sub and I’ll never be able to finish reading it.
You should have noped out of the whole thing the moment the racist with a racist character came into the picture.
This is the noise I make in my girlfriend’s ear while y’all are still scared to moan
"I really hope I don’t ever experience a mid life crisis at all. But if I do, I at least want to act my age."
I'm scared for her. The Saudi government has proven to be very brazen in its disrespect for international law.
i get the joke and still think this sucks.

Dont forget [NAME]. He was a reliever converted to starter. Hes got some ridiculous pitches just needs to work on consistancy
"Great, now my balls hurt and I’m yawning uncontrollably. "
You don't get to decide what is discussed in this thread. You are not in charge here.
"Most of the people on top aren't even very relevant anymore, at least not nearly as relevant as they used to be"
That sounds delicious! Looks like I’m making a trip to the supermarket today.
That knife looks awfully familiar... *snorting and claw clicking in the distance*
Hugs hugs hugs. So many big hugs and good vibes. That's the only thing I know how to say right now.

Running with a gun and a sensor dart out makes me feel so cool.
Bags are packed. Have to leave the country at a minimum as it's one of those gyms that's all over the place. Bad times.
"Nah, substance abuse is sad, period. "
"If this is how earth is meant to function then it is a literal hell, as dark luciferian beliefs reign supreme."
Occupation badges are dumb and I’m sad they made the transition to OCP.
also that fiat (if paid in Bolivares) will quickly depreciate in a week
"Lucky, when I did it my nickname ended up being [NAME]"
This post is bad because the only good phone is the Palm Pre 3 running webOS
Disgusting making [NAME] talk to this fat moron
"The only ""pro choice"" I like is pro choice of guns! Another LIBERAL trolled epic style"

I’m broke as shit and already do that.
"Wow, a Walmart Truck Stop. I think that would be outstanding! They should do that everywhere, I mean they already have the land."
A hatred for loot boxes and a desire to get them banned was quite popular on Reddit.
He is better at public relations than the previous popes but he is basically just as bad when it comes to not punishing pedophiles
"Yeah but i have hard time finding keyboards under 60€ that are blue switches with nkro, if u have some suguesstions please leave a link."
"Nope. That’s a really inaccurate, misleading headline."
Looks like the map didn't render for him
"I don't know in what way the 1% can tweet ""Qu'ils mangent de la brioche"" and not offend the 99%."
That's true for every loss except for this one. He's being really petty and hasn't taken the [NAME] loss well.
That can be a perfect gift for a [NAME]. Amazing work !!
"You mean FUStrated, it's [NAME] here :)"
"I WILL NOT OBEY THAT ORDER, GENERAL! "
I appreciate you taking the time to at least justify your reasoning but I still very much disagree.

"The same here. It's hard to be alone, but not as hard as the eggshells and abuse."

It makes me mad when people steal them lol... chances are if you're nice I'll just *give* it to you
"This is so crazy pessimistic. A generic [NAME] will win with plenty of room to spare, the problem is that ""generic"" candidates don't exist"
Yeah that’s how I feel but that might be kinda hard to explain to non lgbts 😕
"Eh, some people grow up, get tired of banging their heads and decide to start using them instead 😜"
"Probably because they are trying to talk about the issues that ""corporate dems"" tend to ignore. "
This is why you should only ever do incremental payments based in the work done.
"I agree with everything you said, except the Witten part he is [NAME] awful....that whole MNF crew makes it unwatchable."
"If I was any of those and my parents needed it, of course I'd do it. Everyone else: fuck you, pay me."
That ice is dangerously thin for such a hot take.
Threatening to drive your sisters into the ocean is illegal. It's called making a terroristic threat or menacing and can cause her to lose access to your sisters
Chills. I can’t wait. I’m sure [NAME] will get over this not being happy because they have bigger fish to fry.
"This would just be to make it on/off, [why make it look even more amazing."
No that would be yet another mistake.
>the satisfaction of knowing how bent out of shape you're getting What a sad existence.
"Gold Coast seems like it would go well on paper, but turn up to the actual thing and seems strangely disappointing would be good to tell friends about though"
Keeping the stomach warm also helps. Holding the baby with their stomach against yours helps them fall asleep. But it doesn't work all the time unfortunately.

I had forgotten it was coming up until I saw this. That us my level of excitement and anticipation.
Omg I know. She honestly looks so uncomfortable. There HAS to be someone better who could host?!
Wow I got a virus from just looking at this post
I can't even be mad that you scored a goal with your face.
It's not exactly hard to keep track.
It seems as if you are the one that is unable to feel women.
I’m going to die right now I’m so scared tears and snot everywhere
"That's not a healthy way of thinking. Obviously that dude was troubled and, without proper help, he would have done these things regardless."
I've seen this multiple times and wonder what happened to her after this.

Can't believe people like this actually exist.

Weird. He's like the one capitalist in this sub that I feel I've had substantive conversations with.
[NAME] Wednesday’s 😎 Good to know he’s enjoying the retirement life. 
Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.

Goddamn. I'd tap the fuck out if I was that other guy.
I wish I could tell you if it was a good t.v. Let me just find the MOTHERFUCKING REMOTE!!!!!!!!

I read this to my 17 year old brother and he was kinda pissed off just saying
"I hated [NAME], but only because I thought he was good and played for the Cowboys. I feel the same way about [NAME] and [NAME]. "
I just think it's metal as fuck that she was charged with mayhem.
Obviously because libtards cant read big paragraphs. We need them to be broken up like that or we wouldnt be capable of understanding his super smart answer.
"Problem is, it is Bantam and younger. I can teach breakouts easy enough and I don't need a panicked D zone to do it."
I got mine a few months ago and honestly apprehensive to wear it out to a game in fear of staining it.
카니발 sounds more like cannibal than carnival.
Because Im going to feel sorry for the death of someone who assaulted me. Sure thing buddy.
"As someone who works in the oil industry with a lot of big ships, this is badass."
That is so beautiful. It makes my heart hurt that humans can be cruel to animals when they're aware of having so much emotion.
I don't like [NAME] this season but she's always been a favorite before. Am I the only one? She has an edge that seems unlikable
[NAME] the curse is real. This ones on you LeBatard.

Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.
Can't you tell that [NAME] is a serious threat to apprehend. All that alleged lying makes him a serious threat to others.
Sorry about that. I hope the fix is more appropriate. Thank you!
Right back at ya! Also love the username!
Wow 40 years at 18 wow how unfortunate.
"The abilities look cool, but that trait is a little dull. It's almost exactly the same as [NAME]."

"Third down signal in football, too. THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS ARE EVERYWHERE!!"
YES! I can't recommend this TED Talk enough and I think it's really disappointing that many portions of the left have caved in to anti-nuclear hysteria.
Im fine with complaining. A little surprised he's complaining without playing or even reading the patch notes since they were released.
Exactly. My father is part of Homeland security and is furloughed. Homeland Security isn't completely shut down but they furloughed part of their work force.

You have terms where the other person can't hang out with someone of the opposite sex? How is it gaslighting?
Hard to swallow pills. This sub is meh now
You look like a failed attempt to gene splice [NAME] and [NAME] DNA
Socially it's completely unacceptable to pee your pants.

Please stop uploading twitter links. There's a reason people ask for/post mirrors.
"Don’t rush it .... it will eventually all fall into place, Enjoy today "
I'm sorry you poop your pants every time someone mixes those words up.
[NAME] gets punched in the head and gets a penalty.
"I freakin’ love doing this, too!!! Makes me happy for a second or two!"
that's weird... playing Smash Ultimate usually just makes me feel like drinking.
"Omg. I just noticed that! Holy fuck, how does she smell?"
This team doesn’t deserve to go the playoffs. Only [NAME] deserves to go. Is that possible?
"Yeah, life in America is horrifying. Give me a break. "
No surprise there. It was always his policy to table it upon the deal's failure in Parliament as was set out at the Labour conference.
My inevitable famine is when I run out of pop tarts and get sad
"The constant pressure definitely isn't helping. I'm already on anti-depressants, but I am terrified of PPD."
As a student in DC Universities I hope to fucking god they get rid of blackboard and replace it with canvas.
Not when it’s literally contradicted and not corroborated by every other one of that witnesses’s witnesses.
"wow it’s literally disgusting that you’re getting downvoted for pointing out that she abuses her kids. this is the society we live in, eugh"
I feel bad for these guys. I'd like to be able to help ex-mos in trouble.
Can't relate because the sadness and loneliness is constant 😎
Thanks for posting this OP. Many times people change their minds and do the right thing but unfortunately we don't hear about it.
A UBI has to be sustainable. Taxing something to reduce its use and funneling that money into something people would depend on is absolute stupidity.
Always on the back of my mind when that's the last thing I want.
Hahaha thanks for sharing that is simply amazing. You probably gave the buyer a good laugh too.
I will call the police if you dont stop harassing me
You are so ugly even tears wont show up near you
Yep. No more lead on the roofs.
I’m broke as shit and already do that.
It is. It’s so bad. Then I start blaming myself for liking them. It’s like I have no control over this.
I like [NAME] but I disagree with him here. Then again it's not much surprise that a mega rich globetrotter that lives next to [NAME] would hold such views.
A tshirt. I actually bought the cutest shirt that has a nasa logo on it and it says I just need some space. I love it.
"I guess not, thanks for clearing it up mate"
Me and my brother were both born and raised in SC but both our parents are from MI. So we were raised fans from the beginning
I just told myself I wasn't going to check this subreddit until I'd beaten the episode. And I didn't.
"No. There's a fair amount of nudity, violence and foul language. "
Ambien your posts are delightful and I have such a hard core internet stranger crush on you.
"One post, 155 updogs. I've seen this raw power only once before."
I can never refold the paper properly so kudos just for that!
Damn if we could beat the Spurs ~~reserves~~ that would be great
for a moment i got scared and wondered what was this doing here then i read the happy ending
No. Spend all of it ASAP. Spend the evidence so you can get rid of it quickly and safely while also still being able to buy shit!
"Omg, the kitty bites the knee and then looks at the human to gauge reaction."
They got ripped apart here (On Reddit) a few weeks ago for passing false information on aircraft videos and taking legit criticism poorly.
I just hope [NAME] isn't pulling the wagon. Would hate for her to throw up.
Officially worse than Telkom. Well done vuma
105 strikeouts over 81 2/3 innings. that's good lol [NAME]
And you better fucking get there early too! Bargain shoppers don't fuck around.
"damn, I searched ""mocap"" and ""motion capture"", but they didn't use those terms in the title there."
Really that's not very sad at all
OMG! I can only imagine. I've gotten it into a hang nail before and that was NOT fun.
Can you stop living with this person? Engaging in it will only make it more toxic
"He did a [NAME] score? ... yup, that's how unmemorable it was"
I don’t even like [NAME] that much but she completely failed to engage with his work critically. Her interpretations of his arguments were shockingly poor.
And the dude dropped his phone between those slots... ouch!
Wow. So I figure you two are both at least considerably older than me (24) and ...wow his response
I don't even know who he is but I think he approved me to submit in his subreddit.
[NAME] [NAME] Bros are losing their minds over this tweet.
Minimalist aesthetic stuff that doesn’t look goofy.
Are you surprised. He doesn’t do anything with himself
I said this somewhere else.. but I swear that man in the hood is caucasian... But that was actually hilarious
You have no legs to stand on to accuse me of such.
And you can't really see the bottom part so that's probably small too. Really grosses me out
Yayyy!!! Go little green bean go!!! Good job trainer!!
I picked it so it forced me to stay anonymous.
Very disappointed to find out that you can’t play NCAA football on PS4. Wack.
"I too have had this happen on XBONE. I really want to love this game, but it keeps giving me reasons to play something else."
"You're making me look bad [NAME], while she yells and screams."
Not a good couple hours. A full 33 days.
Guys a complete troll who has no idea about cancer or the physical pain it can cause. Move on and don’t give the cunt the satisfaction.
Food stamps are a disgrace. People should get money!
And it’s only 100 degrees with 90% humidity.
That's still crazy to me as it's the same price online and in store here. We just have a flat rate.
That will have to be MY cake then!
"I think there is something odd about it too... We will probably get the truth it the not to distant future, but no one will care. "
Theesomes won't make someone monogamous more open to solo stuff.
We may destroy the rest of the world in the process.
[NAME] being the most manipulative person in the house was not something I expected
Im not 😀 Glad you realize your mistake and why I was confused 😉
Look at all the trash at that festival. Fucking gross.
No that's your interpretation of the truth. A whore is an old and demeaning term for a professional sex worker. You just get off on being degrading to women.
"I was booing loud, so were a lotta others. That muthafuckah"
This is unironically the worst trade I've ever seen.
"I’m now a [NAME] fan! Hope he does well, gl my Canadian brother ❤️"
This. One of my biggest pet peeves. What the hell does it even mean?
"Yeah that’s one of the things I’m most worried about, still hopeful!"
It would be hilarious if it was a pasta place too
Oh dear lord. Imagine if [NAME] scores off the break from a scoring chance of [NAME] and [NAME]
You are oddly defensive about a random chef. Did you come to /r/wewantplates just to insult people and build up this chef? [NAME]
Idk what tf that is😂.... Don’t hate me guys!

They were just gonna do a review parody of their favorite movie. What’s hard to understand?
I read fuck and not tuck. Was wondering how the hell it wasn't creepy....
What in the fuck was [NAME] doing there
I'm phobic of needles and babies so that was NOT a picture I wanted to see.
"Ouch, my heart. I never even thought about this..."
i actually laughed at that lol good one man
I'm sorry but this sounds very much purposeful. How exactly is headbutting someone an accident?
>The ABC’s hard-hitting investigation :/ Such a sad article.
dude people here can be assholes. there’s nothing wrong with taking a break.
Wow this was awful. What kind of audience do these morons have? I mean no one with the money to buy that junk would watch these fools
"Dude I don’t even know what that guys deal is, but honestly, I feel bad for him"
"I'm so happy that this worked for you! Go forth, and have unashamed sex in my honour."
Almost downvoted you just because that made me so angry.
"I know I should be worried, but I am not, which makes me very worried. "
"Honestly just tired of this shit, people who'd rather see us tank than push for playoffs. Literally want us to be the fucking Suns."
Now I really want to see them. Stupid brain!
This really bothers me too. I completely agree. It would have helped us avoid a US situation. Now I think we're barreling toward it
Thanks! It is too bad we can't suddenly age [NAME] and [NAME] a year or so.
Goosebumps had the same take on those too. Those books used to scare the shit out of me
"Wow! I’ve never seen so many deleted comments, and that’s saying something."
"Ok that makes sense. Im familiar with the term.dog whistling, just havent seen ot attached to globalists."

Stop thinking about yourself. Go help someone and work hard at being useful. There's no satisfaction or fulfillment in self-obsession. Get over yourself.
[NAME] is garbage in every single game he plays. He needs to be traded
Then I disagree that being a cog in someone’s machine is reason to be resentful.
Not terribly many of those jumping fences in the UK I think. :P
Free will is about not having to justify everything you do. It's about spontaneity. It's about doing things just because.

"At the very least, I’m glad he tried something other than the standard blue. And yeah, I think the title is above-average as well. "
You take that back right now! [NAME] does not deserve this.
[NAME] was attractive physically and got a match. [NAME] wasn't unattractive in his behavior and got an invitation for sex.
"Teacher: Huh, I never though he'd really do that."
Yes. He was. Fuck off with your bullshit double standards.
"Bear in mind the first sighting was at 9pm, hard to get good footage after sunset"
[NAME] BREAK THE GAME. WHY HAVE YOU GIVEN ALL THE KILLERS A FUCKTON OF THEM. ITS SO DAMN STUPID.
It's sad that we have to think of it as a miracle and not a regular occurrence :/
I work on a farm. I can confirm can be dangerous. I have a hard time imagining a scenario where being a cop is more dangerous.
Not a good couple hours. A full 33 days.
Weird I can relate to this but in the same time I can't relate to this
I'll take the Akot 3 but man that shot is ugly
Wow what a final quarter. [NAME] throwing two intersepts. What a dog

I actually enjoy watching this while eating
[NAME] I hate when people rhyme things for no reason
I’ve never stolen anything to do this with an Italian accent.
This pretty boy didn't meet [NAME] ! That's why he's still full of life !
[NAME] could be so valuable if we didnt rely on him to create
Cheers brother. That’s very interesting. First time I’ve seen that article.
No it’s a lie because he could not possibly have been in Vietnam. And he did not correct a single outlet who said he was.
Exactly right! It would help if my fingers could type properly lol. Burr smh!
I could upload this to YouTube if I wanted to. No problem. You couldn’t do anything.
I wonder why you're sitting at -2 for that comment. Very strange.
So that’s what it looks like when it’s not a flop
Yup. That doesn't contradict what I said- this isn't a derailing conversation that I was starting.
Let's not pretend that all fetishes are fine.
There is something terrifying about petite crazy girls. LOL. The scariest girl in my middle school probably weighed 90 lbs. Everyone was scared of her.
They hated [NAME] because he told them the truth
"Great, now I want to pee in it."
So now disabled people don’t have rights . You get worse .
[NAME] death is just so..... senseless. Why? WHY??? The based gods have forsaken us
I can’t look at [NAME] with this hair!
I haven't been able to find my 9th in the recliner in 3 weeks... 10th time is the charm I guess
Agreed. The only sensible option is to throw half a fit when people disagree with you!

Let him walk away from the town just far enough that you can lasso him and drag him into the fields. Worked for me
"Where the mask inside, too? Are air purifers not good enough for inside? Sorry for the dumb question... Just moved here this week."
So no resignation or impeachment. Bummer. Naive me had high hopes the great [NAME] wouldn't escape the noose this time.
This is almost worse than Santa Con. Can we get millenials to destroy this please.
Wow! I can save $15 and buy this used version?!?!? How wonderful!
The nerve of that [NAME] album on his wall. I still can’t believe he has a child.
You get closure by blocking her on your phone and all social media. She dumped you. It's over.
I feel left out... I never get invited to our new world order meetings with our elders of zion
I dated a Pens fan from SWB and can confirm this is very much a weird thing.
Well they called and said there was a pricing discrepancy and they could not honor it. 😭 sad day.

Only married once so can't be that bad. Not that it even matters
"I wonder how that works if the seatbelt wouldn’t fit even if they were sitting in a regular seat? They only go so far, right?"
I actually listened to the entire joke... and I read the press release from the CHRT. How about you?
That isn't the issue. The issue is shilling your channel.

[NAME] why are there so many guendouzi haters?
I put so much thought into things that often I trigger myself unintentionally. I can be hurt before something has a chance to happen.
I love flying out of Midway because I feel like I have never waited more than 10 minutes for security. I love the lines at Midway.

"That’s why it’s petty revenge. It may have been petty to take a bit of enjoyment in it, but she made her own bed"
Market ≠ Capitalism Just because something operates within the Capitalist system doesn't make it Capitalist. Just because [NAME] was (supposedly) elected didn't make him democratic

I dare each or any of you fuckasses to try and blame [NAME] for this one

I mean she’s barely into college so she’s only maybe 18-20 but to be this oblivious is pretty sad.

I’m not a fan of that hire at all... I’m also not a fan about how that all came out. All around bad.
I hope that the talk goes ok. Though with these justno's it may not. I'm glad that you are prepared if it goes south.

I hate that you've forced me to deal with a reality I've been blissfully ignoring.

The space between the M and the E always looks a tad too long with these cheaper jerseys.
This is a really lovely ends to a crappy means. I’m glad you enjoyed yourself and got something out of it.

He keeps saying this in my playthrough when that's definitely NOT what I'm doing. I just suck at hunting!!

I feel like the world just doesn’t want [NAME] to have the spotlight. This is torture for a [NAME] fan like me. :’(
Life is just an endless series of disappointments and no one gets out of here alive.

He probably banked on the inherent secrecy of the community and ignorance (on Belgian law) of his victims.
"Big man going round the world asking for protection money. And all that time the Pentagon cringes, as they would lose a key base around China."

We all are afraid of losing our jobs here or being blackballed all the same.
Aww a homophone on top of everything else. No wonder you carry a gun. You’re a coward who’s afraid of the world.
That's no trip. That's a hip check with flair.

Well that's an awful superpower to have. Maybe you could fix [NAME] tho.
You got me. Now gimme the downvotes I DESERVED
"Please, please, please don't do that to yourself. You'll end feeling worse when this guy leaves you. "
Is this because of the sudden spate of comments feeling shocked that we don't respect proud right leaners or have you always had these mails?

"No I didn’t think that, it was the way the information was presented"
"Given that you're not a conservative and this isn't a debate sub, how about you just get the hell out and stay out."
"No, but it changes the expectations that people have for you. You have so deliberately change who you are to play to your target audience."
"It sounds like you’re the one who is afraid of the internet. Relax, bud. You’re on r/cringe "
Wtfr*ck [NAME] would never say n word !

This moment always reminded me of being a kid and turning on Nickelodeon only to find Nick News with [NAME]. Ultimate disappointment.
"Cant agree more on the first part but for the last, it comes out too harsh."
"Definitely was a nonononoyes for me there lol, I'm a horrible person"

I do but no one wants to play with me I at least try to play by my self but it gets really boring.
I'm honestly shocked that the Bucks have more subs than us. I was surprised the Wolves had more too.
They are all secretly projecting their own cheating onto us. Emotionally stunted 5 year olds with zero impulse control will do that.
great execution for the drawing but bad execution for the meme
I used to have fun with it and didn't feel angry aside for when [NAME] was op lol
"Aww this made me tear up! Please keep posting your poems, they are so special ♥️"
I used to fantasize about my morning oatmeal. One packet of instant oatmeal. [NAME] dreamed about it.

Trolls are not even trying anymore. Im offended by this half arsed attempt to get a rise out of me..
Unfortunately I don't know how to read hangul. I'm still in the very early stages of planning so still lots of things to look at!

You are not the only one. I rage quitted UNO
Thanks. I want to travel the world but have no reasonable way of affording it.
Have you ever brought up your concern before? I understand if that is the only issue but if it doesn't change it could fester.
True i hate going to parties or concerts but love going to a bar or a houseparty.
we just don’t match amazon at all to avoid this sort of thing.
"Unless they end up with [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME] (or similiar), this will be a huge failure. Yikes."

"That does suck. I’m sorry. Having recently been ghosted by someone who I thought was a very close friend, it’s a terrible feeling"

He just can't deal with the fact that he finds you hot.
No no no i didnt learn about that in my middle school bio class so it can't be real 😤
A surprise to be sure! But a welcome one
"Hell, no. Teenagers just aren't that interesting."

Sorry man I don’t really like duck.
"No, because I don't have to. This is an ""Everyone else"" problem."
That explains an awful lot about ICP.

How random. I did that just riding around town for no reason and saw that lighting.
Ain’t that the truth. August is Hell!!
"I've been here too long. My first response was: ""I imagined worse."""

Not sure why you are getting downvoted for this comment. I really dislikes the Facebook type posts on this sub.
Literally everywhere. There's nothing especially Texan about any of this. I heard all of this in freaking SCONSIN.

Stumbling out of a closet in full [NAME] outfit... I'm afraid it's not
"[NAME] and [NAME] were the ones I had in mind, but I'm not surprised they're not the only ones from what I've heard."
I don't think eating 4chan pizza is a good idea. Unless you're into some weird shit.
"I find porn disgusting and boring, could this be a sign I'm asexual?"
"This would be better posed in r/GCdebatesQT, thank you."
I’m going to say it. Those films are mostly over rated. Boring same old tame CGI stuff every time.
I did not post this. I really do find it funny tho
"C’mon man, read the comment, if you love [NAME] so much why don’t you shaft him"
"But if you connect to the Internet, then you don't need no stinking procedures!(end bad spanish accent)."
Teen spirit sure ain't what it used to be...
Agree with most of above apart from TERA is no cash grab unlees you just want to fast forward a little with gear and it really is a little lol
It’s not outrageous though. Just a 2 night hotel stay alone for 1600 people will be around 200k.
I’ve always wondered why they play at ear splitting volume instead of one where you can enjoy the music.....
Oh god no!!! I was gonna get some shipped out to save you some money. Never mind.
"Makes sense, but I imagine if they wanted the land that badly theyd just buy it off him"
Ain’t that the truth. August is Hell!!
Guys. Our defense is bad outside of like two guys.
"No, he said he's bringing in somewhere around 10K a month, not 2500 a month. That's a HUGE income gap."
They killed [NAME] for being a [NAME] right after this. [NAME] was a notorious anti-Semite.
I think this is my favourite story of the year so far.
"There. Are. No. Moderate. Republicans. Repeat this, nonstop, everytime she is mentioned. She is an extremist who pretends to be moderate."
"[NAME] would be fun [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], [NAME], and possibly [NAME] would make us prime contenders for hard knocks "

Well I mean this game is so stupid in a lot of ways tbh
"""We're the greatest country on the earth!"" says not-Canada"
His definition of a grown man is someone who drinks irresponsibly and then beats people up. GET OUT.
Right but even without the FPTA surely we could have found ourselves in the same situation from a legal perspective?

Me but with boobs. When will be able to trade body parts [NAME]
He can do a balloon party with his brony friends
Thanks for your kind words. They made me tear up a bit.
"You sure are outraged about some people making fun of [NAME]. Gee, that's easy!"
Crime in the park is the only kind of crime that matters for the sake of this discussion. Your generality does not apply here.
omg this is a bit too relatable
I was jumping the same gun but decided to do some googling just in case. Glad I did :)
Cut out the middle man! Be oppressed directly by your corporate overlords!
Not a deal breaker for me. But it depends on a lot of factors. How and when she takes it and so?
You don't get to decide what is discussed in this thread. You are not in charge here.
Such bullshit. Reloading components included? Not that they'd let that stand in subsequent laws if it is.
Well you're lying about my pun being better bitch

WOW I love this photo so much! Is this recent?
Makes us wonder what its going to be like for my children's generation..
The contempt from [NAME] in these threads lately is seriously disappointing.
"So police were banned from having holidays, not police banned everyone else from having holidays"

Must be why I'm alive. That sucks.
Pretty sure it's a rubber toy made to look like one
"Oh damn, that would have been the only correct response! ""Sorry, but I have a boyfriend."" End of conversation."
What no one in the history of time has ever recovered from a bad first date? Hard pass on this anecdotal evidence.
[NAME] will be proud of people who share links from conspiracy websites in order to “defend” him. Hahahahaha
There was nothing innovating lol. It was good but chill
"Well shit, if all you gorgeous people haven’t settled down yet, there’s no hope for me"
"I'd of pushed the little brat into the puddle, assuming I hadn't smacked him with the book"

I got an unsolicited text from wal-mart earlier today and I almost went into orbit. Spam texts are completely unacceptable.
Not an awful offer but I don't know if I see AD promising to resign long term in Dallas.

i got a bump and a bald spot. i feel dumb <3
Definitely not a misunderstanding if you read the articles Bloomberg posted.
These are some of the lamest threatening letters I’ve ever seen. She’s a metahuman who can you murder people with her voice.
You can't just make bold claims like that and provide no evidence.
"[NAME] fucked up with this line up. Why do you change it, if everything was going good? Idiot! "
"Because he's in dirt, and probably didn't have much practice "
"There's too much focus on ""our side Vs their side"" and things just seem to be getting worse"
You sound quite childish and unable to engage with any information that doesn’t conform to your narrative. Sad.
That's odd. Where I live it all the disapproval has been silent. The loud people are older cougar ladies that are into that kind of thing.
I hieaa i just trip out how your lds and not know or here. Nevermo here a d hears when i was a kid
"Wow, time to talk to the [NAME] about a FPTP alternative."
That was intentional as fuck. I don’t know how anyone could argue that after that insane contortionist layup over [NAME] last week.
Franchise QB's are leaders who set the tone for the entire lockerroom. [NAME] is a terrible leader.
Honestly i have no clue. Just got my feelings hurt by the mean things he was saying to nurk and wanted to cyberbully him in response
"Too bad no crossprog with PS4 thanks to Sony, though I heard gamedevs are trying to talk it out with them"

> [NAME]. You disgust me. But seriously when do we get a real show and skip the constant ad teases.
"errrrrrrrrr that's pointless, and your Doctor I'm afraid is pointless as well."
That’s a lazy argument. Racism can be defeated with good education and proper parenting but most people are too lazy to fight for it.
I feel like I lost focus... I have not accomplished anything and the clock isn't really stopping
I mean I don't think he's gonna come out and call [NAME] a bitch even if he feels that way

Oh look a player breaking out of a slump against Dallas. Haven't seen this one before
This why we can’t have nice things! I would’ve beat him up for taking with my non-existent mans away 😤
Fuuuuck. I am so angry that this can even happen.
I do the exact same. It typically does the job and most people are just mad at people who steal rather than me.

It definitely doesn't work if you give up.

[NAME] playing for the heat always makes me laugh
"Find a tv show to participate in, bat your eyes, cry a little. "
This is not a comedy subreddit. It is a subreddit about the unexpected.
"Yea feel sad for that kid, that native guy is an anti [NAME] activist who destroyed his life "
"I don't even care about the draft, I've tasted playoff hopes and I'm not going back."
Not the kind of webcams we can afford.
It kind of surprised us how much of a feeling of control it gave us.
"I can't see a way forward, neither the government or the opposition wants no-deal or to cancel A50. "
I supported a third party lunatic. Huge difference.
Can't believe people like this actually exist.
We're not exactly short on white homophobes either though.
[NAME] and his supporters are the dumbest humans in the fucking galaxy. They should be locked up for their own safety.
There is no Mrs [NAME]. Unless you count his sister.
"And maybe one day you'll be able to afford one, but until then continue being an edgy teenager whining about the war on drugs. "
I’m not going to be a scared wizard and call him he who must not be named
Sounds like they’re not responsible and shouldn’t have the right to have these.
There's no better way to make yourself miserable than by comparing yourself to others.
Oh neat! I didn't realize you guys shot it. I figured the company had set up a tripod. In that case I retract my complaint.
"Australia? Edit: No, [NAME], but awfully similar to the situation here in Australia."
Having fled to the other side of the planet 15 years ago.
thats messed up...thats why i dont like reddit as much
Oh nice I was wondering if you could mix flavours. I'll still stick to mint though 🤷‍♂️
A couple things: Fuck Nazism. Enjoy the ban for trolling!
Yeah because a country can't multitask. Go pedal your propaganda elsewhere
Doesn't change the fact that they shadowbanned a subreddit. Just because YOU think it's stupid doesn't make that ok.
Not under [NAME]. Under [NAME] desperate greedy extreme partisan coward politics. They purposely brought racism front and center.
"I feel like you should, in commemoration."
"It sounds like you’re enzyme deficient, I’ve never heard of someone becoming sensitive to a drug from using it "
It sucks that you had to go through that. I hope you're doing fine now (and your kids if any).
Thanks! I’m Excited To See How This Meme Become In The Future!
I like [NAME] but I disagree with him here. Then again it's not much surprise that a mega rich globetrotter that lives next to [NAME] would hold such views.
Ooh you made them?! Awesome!! I hope you enjoyed them. 5 cheeses sounds like a great decision.
"so blame porn not the conditions that pushed them to use it as to the point of an ""addiction"" got it. "
"More like a baptism, with sexy results!"
Maybe its the picture but the fabric looks really bad
"Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos."
"It's great, though kind of painful if you ever had dreams of writting/drawing/making a comic/game/novel it hurts a lot."
Buddy. Your prejudice is showing. Also plot twist I'm a white [NAME] woman. You don't understand the principle of what white privilege is.
> punishment for saying no to rape Surely if you wanted to rape someone you'd have to punish them for saying yes...
The worst is when those moments pop up randomly. Especially when you’re feeling happy and then a mistake you did back in 2005 comes creeping up.
Currently have 2 points. One is from when my cat died and the other is from a really bad migraine.
A car. Let someone else eat the immediate depreciation and break it in for you.
"Yes, absolutely. ""But woe to the one who betrays me. It would have been better for that man, if he had never been born."""
"Or better yet, live through it and then have nightmares and paranoia the rest of your life"
Sorry English is not my native language. I love weed but I worry about my lungs too. What do you mean?
I'm scared to do these cuz the S.A.G.E. told me I was a transvestite
Wow braised diaper shit damn you're on fire 🔥 
When has the Alt-Right ever been working class? Its always the richest white guys who are horribly socially inept.
"They fetishize our oppression. Different day, same tune. "
"I am just afraid the Pistons front office, specifically [NAME] overvalues [NAME] and says no to this."
"Never made it through, it makes me physically ill just seeing images of that monster combined with him describing his incomprehensible evil."
"I think Limmy's Show is really hit and miss. Some sketches are funny, others are just poor."
I cried reading your last posts. I’m so sorry about what happened. I hope you are able to make a change in their system.
[NAME] getting off beat the dribble is hurting me a little inside /: Edit:words
IMO the car was mostly at fault for abruptly jumping into the other lane without signaling.
I could crush him like a bug right now.
> I just don't see how this movie wouldn't get dull after about a half hour. then cut it at 90 min.
I was already having doubts with how Olicity-heavy it suddenly became
>it should be **illegal** to teach **religion** to young children Do you believe in a separation of church in state though?
And you truly need to be there and see this wide spread nonchalant attitude to truly understand it how bad and rampant it is.
Yet *I* get banned for saying you should downvote posts you don’t like. Fml
"Did I present a braiwashing sect as something positive? Both are bad, but at least you can therapy your way out of emo."
Dude wtf that was definitely off Brooklyn
Yes. I often dream of death or further isolation
Haha I've never seen a BritSovcit video but now I'm gonna have to check some out
"I stand corrected, my apologies to the mods. I'd personally like to see more banned or removed but at least they handled the most egregious."
Those ads actually make me feel bad for financial advisors gouging clients with excessive fees.
I have the worst memory ever. Idk if it's from all the weed I smoked but I also have a blank mind like all the time.
Oh cool. Did everything else that got listed not happen either?
This is so painfully 80s. I hate it.
"For real though, I do apologize. That's a bad run of luck for sure, it's such a rare syndrome "
"I think that would fall under exile, right? Do you think its important prisons/prisoners are somewhat self sufficient?"
A lot of people call that this is only one they made her sick
"lmao dana just like ""i fucking hate my nephew"""
Our road still hasn’t been salted on Troy Hill
just fed up of reading subjective opinions be paraded as fact that he was the worse ever.
"""That's impossible."" ""It's necessary."" If they were aiming to make a [NAME] a steely-eyed missile man, they succeeded. "
Is that the only symptoms you’ve noticed? Are you normally worried for social situation?
No. It’s not. This is disgusting behavior and anyone who supports it is a fool.
She talks about him getting some manners... She's the only without manners... and she should've gotten kicked off...
"Now I'm wondering if [NAME] drinks, and if he's ever been inebriated during one of his deals."
"Lol I don’t disagree, but the perimeter defense let them walk into the paint. You can blame [NAME] too."
"That's not a healthy way of thinking. Obviously that dude was troubled and, without proper help, he would have done these things regardless."
"Dude, she had just lost her baby, too. "
"Basic translation ""I'd rape you if I weren't a virgin!"" Super creepy."
"I couldn't let [NAME] become carver.. I regret it. [NAME] didn't deserve this, although he was fucking stupid to let his guard down"
Yeah you’re implying that someone holds the shitty opinion you just made up. Which is basically an attempt to make them look bad. Character assassination.
Too bad it's the wrong kind of blows!!!
Amazing work!. I truly enjoyed reading this and read like a page directly from the book.
"You should’ve baked it in the oven, huge difference in quality. One of my favorite lonely Friday night Netflix meals."
No I know they're on xbox. I just added that last part as a poor attempt to be funny.
This is a genuinely good point. It’s enough to take me from giving zero shits to giving a modest shit against them.
Seriously! Such an odd way to ask a question about traveling.
Haha love it we'll uhm not the penis
Because the hierarchy is afraid they’ll get burned.
"I dunno, I'm picturing completely beige and generic baby shower. Beige streamers and balloons, a banner that says ""there will be a birth""..."
Remember the year “Song 2” was number 2? Good times.
"Yeah, clear off. And tell your mates you had a horrible time too. "
"Oh, sweet. It's the gaming guy who hasn't uploaded any gaming videos yet! /s (I like him and am just poking fun)"
This is a very offseason thing to say
I will never forgive and never forget for this one
I almost didn't finish this stranger mission because I just *knew* it was going to be bad.
"Darn. I'm sorry, I didn't know that. I honestly am out of ideas and I don't know what to do."
> Sleeping next to someone I knew my wife is trying to kill me!
"the force awakes wasn't a clear insult, it was just mediocre."
"Well folks, no more amputations for diabetics, as it leaves the individual permanently disfigured..."
"Great, so we know the spanish pronounciation is therefore racist and now I'm offended by it."
I guess I am totally alone but I am really enjoying the audiobook and haven’t had a single complaint. I’m half way through now
"You win , I’m so wrong to think that anyone would take advantage "
That’s exactly what I was thinking but doesn’t it sound super cool?!?
"I’ll be honest I really don’t care. I’m happy to know that others care about this, but eh you do you"
[NAME] always makes my day when he's yelling at the refs
I think thats dumb and simplistic. You really can't boil down the sociology of race by comparing it to 2+2=4.
"Indeed, I'm no expert on the subject, so I'm not going to present a misleading picture."
I feel so guilty that this picture exists. I feel like I need to donate to charity after this.
"I'm sad, but I just want a new Metroid game, and if this is what it takes to make it great then I understand"
"Lol. Well, I enjoyed our heart to heart either way "
This made me smile. I watched it on YouTube.
How is this the epitome of slavery? Nobody is forcing you to do this. Stop being dramatic.
"Some college professors and their teaching staff may need to die. Oh, wait... saying that is hate speech."
It won't make them worse off. GDP is simply irrelevant. Rent and job conditions are what matters.
What's it matter where this came from? It fits every content guideline and we're enjoying it.
I think you might be underestimating some people sadly.
1. Dr. [NAME] job is just cause drama and look frustrated 2. I wanna know the mothers of people ITT
"I'd be fine on the highway, really only stop and go and hill starts, and reversing that I have problems with. "
This can’t be considered cruelty free because now someone’s hair style is gonna suffer
No I think he just meant that losing half of your shit should at least move the needle a little lol
only suckers believe this don't be a sucker
"Some fragile egos seem very upset at the ad. womp, womp."
"I enjoyed it somewhat, but haven't felt like rewatching (or owning) it."
"Nah they’ll just show the one we got today, tomorrow on the WD, I have a feeling. "
That poor girl who said she'd help out is about to get a surprise when she finds out she has to pay for the coffee.
I think everyone would enjoy it more if you did
Don't worry. You'll grow out of Pearl Jam.
No point in getting rid of Keemun for another Keemun.
No no forms or anything. I was pleading with them not to go and it seemed surreal that I was being forced to go
"You're right :) It's not all about aim though Anyways, [NAME] hard to hit lol D:"
The best part of froyo is getting to do it yourself. Robot is useless and bad at it's job.
I hate that I was young enough to not remember this but old enough to remember the next Super Bowl....
I mean clearly it's because they don't understand the pricing for babies/young children on the black market.
[NAME] not calling anything so far. Means they will call everything second half. It’s inevitable.
"""five minutes of fame""... [NAME] lmao. Ok, whatever u say kid."
It’s a substitute teacher. She should know to stay in her lane.
So he is half decent. Glad to see your finally making some sense.
No haha but this is our first day on Reddit!
"I guess ""hungasfuck"" or whatever is not doing gif recipe vids anymore lol"
I don't even know what this is referring to. East Midlands airport? Please post a link.
I'm sad that you are against abortion. Can I drop my unwanted baby off at your door ?
"I just got there and saw ""Chicken Pox"" When the image is about smallpox"
Fucking love my pixel 2 ended up hating every Apple device I owned
But balance does not include the dark side
So far she seems pretty decent but I'm side-eyeing the hell out of him. His conduct at the restaurant was so bizarre and creepy.
Theesomes won't make someone monogamous more open to solo stuff.
I have trophy jeans and a trophy bra! Although RIP my boobs because they were the one thing I liked about my body back then :)
"ah, rejection. i know something about it"
After 8? I'm afraid after 5. It gets dark here early. :(
Hated her. And that was honestly a more offensive reaction than everyone laughing at her IMHO
"Same, I hate myself for finding the last 4 chapters... my heart is devastated."
It's sad that nearly everything seems ok as long as [NAME] told you to do it.
I just physically *shuddered* at the idea of redoing middle school..
I couldn’t agree more! I think deep down all I wish for is some weird validation from women
Now I feel like an idiot calling it a beamer for the 15 years I played baseball.
":( disappointed, i expected to give out personal therapy cats."
Yeah but if you do have a problem you'll be faced with a very difficult decision.
"I’m sorry there was trouble, but I’m glad it ended as okay as it did."
I turned the news on around 6 this morning and have never been so happy to have a commute of 4 miles to my job
>fail at reading comprehension >Other guy must be a troll ¯_(ツ)_/¯
It's not G A M E R time unless we get to berate women and minorities.
QP is either extremely depressing or absolutely amazing. There is no inbetween.
Totes! I love walking round and round and round in circles all afternoon and still not finding the store I need.
"ah thats my bad, she just finished the blog and im sharing it around, one sec and ill edit it. "
It's not that bad. Not even the employees were cringe worthy. I'm glad that they were all enthused about having fun with the seniors.
Omg i probably need to get mint to drop some truth bombs
Hate to say it but having a veteran like him and [NAME] in games like this can make a difference
Theres a pretty big Irish population in Edinburgh/ Glasgow as well that'll likely end up contributing to the support.
"Give him 8/240, ship [NAME] and [NAME] to the Padres in a three-team deal for [NAME]. Boom. I solved the offseason. You're welcome."
"#YOU'RE RIGHT, PEOPLE BEING OUTRAGED BY THE ACTIONS OF A CRIMINAL IS HYSTERICAL!"
I hate people using the [NAME] to look “deep” on instagram posts like that. It gets on my nerves so much
Yeah that's how someone died at Dour festival when swimming in the stone quarry :/
My husband died outside the church Damn Vampires
Tell her off yourself (and poke her in the back) that she's way too old and way too heavy to be pulling this stuff.
"What does that have to do with [NAME] having sex with a child, what's the point you're trying to make with that piece of information?"
It's an underrated drama which just got snubbed on [NAME]
I was scared for that white building.
"Sure, its just that it was completely irrelevant to my reply"
There are far more bad ones than good ones. Stepparents that treat their stepchildren as their own are noteworthy for a reason.
"Our country is in no way, shape or form ready for the risk of a giant inflation wave."
"Lord, he is extra sensitive. And I thought my ex was bad lol. "
No but it would be weird if you masturbated to it like I did
☠️ I felt his pain!!!☠️ R.I.P. furry giblets!!!!☹️
I’m a little scared of telling my parents (I’m in high school.) How do I approach them about this?
I love working with people but sometimes I really hate people. 🤷🤷🤷
"I was always in awe of just how stunning she was. She doesn't photograph well though, it's a shame. "
I didn't think it was that bad tbh
"I really hope you won't have the chance to enjoy them because man, I didn't like them anything :)"
That was so sad. And she kept calling for mommy the whole time. Then they ditched her with grandma.
"Did you miss the other guys link? I noticed you didn't make a comment towards him, even though he posted it around the same time."
Seems like every season she is less hot. Too bad
"It's ironic that those who most strongly embrace TSSC and other churches are so often utterly lacking in any level of true ""faith."""
Thank you for sharing this. May your friend rest easy and you find peace.
"I do not see how that is disgusting. She's cleaning her self and had a discharge, so what? "
Can holiday just stop fucking shooting? I can’t wait till he gets traded.
Just why? No one is going to want to eat their food out of it and placing something on it is pointless
>You're worth a lot more than that and there are so many other impressive and interesting things about you. What an outrageous lie.
She doesn't hate him much if she just kept letting him get away with his racket.
"No I don’t want it to be unhappy or unhealthy AT ALL, just more like a normal/fussy baby."
"Missed that part, but now I see where you are coming from."
"Too lazy to type out ""him/her"" 3x. That and I don't give a fuck."
Nice try hilary but you lost to those idiot minority
"I was just about to comment this. She might be a wonderful human being, but I have suspicions. "
I cant’t stand mint flavored toothpaste. That’s how much I hate mint.
why is this hard to believe it’s totally believable
Love both flags man! I was on my college campus today in my old Thrashers hat while wearing my Jets sweatshirt. Go Jets! Have fun!
Oh noooo. I once accidentally rubbed my eye after handling habaneros. It's the worst.
That is why the us needs to repeal birthright citizenship. For national security reason.
"Maybe not harassment in this tweet in particular, but there are difinitely some fans who are still pressed about eliminations and are not afraid to let the queens know"
Super creepy. And leaving the note is out of line
Wow so you really are pro-abuse huh
This is scary and so very sad. Eleven??? A baby! I was still building forts. I weep for this child.
That's pretty bad though would certainly explain things.
True i hate going to parties or concerts but love going to a bar or a houseparty.
Kinda but it’s still a terrible meme
"Can't let it get to you. You tried, got rejected, so move on.. Believe me I know it's discouraging but everyone gets rejected. "
I'm also a human being but I can't think of any reason why I would physically hurt a woman.
Using an argument based on intolerance is frankly a bad strategic idea and borders on offensive. It won't persuade anybody and it sounds ridiculous.
"The comments on this have me rolling 🤣 more seriously though, I hope everyone’s alright!! ❤️"
"It's a Falling In Reverse song, which makes it even more terrifying"
Me too. I didn't want to promote anybody here but there are way cheaper alternatives with shipping benefits... If you know what I mean.
Didn't really help who the Master is but [NAME] will lose his damn mind. We video game worlds now.
"I used to work with a guy that was always whining how tough his life was. My family this, my friends that. Very annoying"
"Hey, I share a birthday with a legend!"
"It was his time, even though I'm not complaining about how [NAME] should be avoided. thank you very much!"
Oh my good lord. I just somethinged over his highlight reel.
They wont investigate cause the damage isn't worth $1000+
It took me forever to realize it was not in fact [NAME]....
It is 100% a scam. They've been copying many [NAME] with the same message.
"Oh, apologies. Silly me didn’t think to check the sub first."
But once again that is a problem with the people. So many just attack the people who disagree instead of the arguments.
"1.) Its not real socialism 2.) All government is socialism pick one ""socialists"" fire departments arent socialist "
Will forever be burned into my brain! Will never forget the feeling just please not 2 cycles in a row 🙏🏻
"True, but it is deceptive when dealing with c diff, it may give them a false sense of security."
No problem! I’m glad we can help. Hope it goes well
I honestly loved her performance as [NAME] in Scott Pilgrim. But then again I also love Scott Pilgrim so...
"This is just sad. So, so sad."
Keep pressuring the landlord. Threaten to sue them if they don't take care of the problem.
"When he puts it in too fast and you don't have time to let your walls expands, this is exactly how it feels... "
I thought it was going to cut to them still trying to get it out of its mouth! When the kid was holding it again I lost it
ye but that is fucking [NAME]... there is a diffrence between [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] is good but he is no [NAME] ;)
Does anyone have the video of [NAME] drawing the charge I didn't get to see it.
"Yeah, I was very sad to read that!"
What have I watched ?! My eyes!!! Mom!!!
What happened? I can’t stop thinking about this post. Her poor family. Those kids. 😢
Getting tougher to make those mortgage **and** car payments.
"They usually do hoss, hence the steak and beer hard to be sad with good food. "
"Today's Recaptchas were fun. I'm very good at identifying store fronts, apparently..."
Then it would have been removed. Don't assume my thoughts. I cringed. I posted.
[NAME]? I'd be surprised if he plays.
If it's true i'm sad he's leaving but I wish him nothing but the best.
"You're trying to come off smart, but failed. "
You're taking all of this WAY too literally AND making a lot of assumptions.

"While I have no experience in dating/relationships, I have been through unrequited love. So I learnt that the hard way"
Everything purdue throws up goes in. Frustrating. Need to find a way to get stops or this ones over at halftime
Especially from the media that literally hates these players.
"Guess I'm seriously out of shape, I should do something about that. Maybe next week..."
"After watching TLJ, I find it impossible to watch TFA. It's a sequel to some film, but that film is not TFA."
It’s not easy hiding that Baby Huey diaper.
Is that a little poot at :09?
"Seriously, way to miss the point. Even if no liquid falls from their eyes, they suffer immensely."
pretty much correct except for when right wingers get triggered they type on a keyboard and when leftists get triggered they try and ruin the career of whatever offended them
poor mod :( i guess people arent allowed to leave this sub if they are vegan
America v Necaxa Was postponed till March. America doesn't play until next Jornada 2
"I gotta say, that was a WELL fought period. I was worried a couple times..."
I've had sleep paralysis once and it is really bad.
It was never implied as such. You simply mistakenly interpreted it that way.
"Spending my first day ever in Europe. In Oslo, with an amazing girl I met visiting Texas from Norway about a year ago. "
I love the accidental deep frying from the tears on certain words
"Oh gosh, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. It sounds like you handled it really well. Kids are cruel. "
I’ve been kicked in the leg my foots been stamped on. I can’t imagine the pain of this
"Weirdly enough Salad Fingers is one of [NAME] weaker animations, highly recommend ‘The Unfixable Thought Machine’"
It's cuz we've played less games than them
🎵 I review you 👏👏 zero bye bitch gone 🎵
get blood orgies out of our ideology thanks
Wow! You've put my relationship in words I couldn't think of.
12 players had points! Everyone except [NAME] had a shot on goal!
"Do people really use the phrase ""my kid is poorly"" to mean sick? The grammar in this post is really bothering me."
The only thing I remember about that guy was the super racist remarks he made about [NAME].
No because to them this disabled boy is faceless. It’s easier to digest our hate and vitriol without thinking about it.
"Thanks, we were kinda enjoying it at the time too"
I’m the most surprised that [NAME] is 35. Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [NAME] on how to get booze for the party
It's just a natural reaction of people blaming white people as a whole for all the bad things in history.
"[NAME] may lie but he doesn’t when it comes to important things apparently. Jobs, security and anti war"
"Acestream is a great tool, just a shame that it's closed source, makes it a bit scarier for me to use."
The Square. The gross pretentious privilege in this film made me want to puke.
I don’t want my tax dollars going to some psycho who thinks he’s a girl trapped in a mans body
I’m an NA boy and Rival/Dig were my two favorite orgs. Glad to see at least one of them is returning.
I do this but but feel better in the end because I use it for procrastination. It's a weird combinational to feel better and worse while cleaning.
If you wanna spend thousands for every piece of furniture then sure but a lot of people don’t have the budget for this.
god damn this is some major league pathos
Let's say he quits or is fired (we already know neither will happen). Who the [NAME] would we pick to replace him?
"True, but [NAME] mocking someone for making a choice that, realistically, isn't a choice at all is still an oblivious thing to do."
FO need to pull the trigger ASAP. If he’s on this roster after the deadline... [NAME] help us
Looks like one of mine too. Such a horribly raised entitled rude brat
> I am not [begging] for money Yes you are. Rule 2.
But everybody got mad when Russia recognized [NAME] as US president. Go figure.
Ouh shittt my dad is also going to be surprised
At least they don’t say that at a funeral
"No organic webs, no [NAME], no [NAME]. Pack your memes, get out of my subreddit. You're NOT [NAME]!"
Fuck no i wanna kill the living shit out of [NAME]
Wtf did I just read? That was painful
oh man that actually sounds gross in that context
"I hadn’t even noticed the hairline, was too busy looking at the rest of the awful stuff going on."
🤷🏼‍♀️ I was wondering the same thing. It looked almost like a teriyaki.
"Yeah, 16 yearolds being attracted to other 16 yearolds sure is creepy... "
The point is no 13yr old is perfect and shit happens that doesn't mean they were scumbags that deserved to die for making the wrong choice.
Yeah we're just awful. Sadly that's too friggin' true just now!
I hate these memes because [NAME] never cared if he did or didn't have a nose.
"Considering you are also a child, I can't say I'm surprised by your edgy hot take."
Maybe he wanted to get rid of both of them and thought he'd go out with a bang?
Plot twist: the customer just found she's diabetic and that's why she's crying.

"Seattle has both, and is building a huge extension to the existing light rail system. Traffic is still absolutely fucked."
"That used to be my favorite view on the planet, but now it’s just rage. I can’t look anymore."
"Probably because its likely, unfortunately. The question is what happens next for people that are obsolete."
Because it’s a lot for someone to handle and i haven’t had any outbursts etc that would’ve resulted from that
Ehhh he got played so hard on the [NAME] vs [NAME] situation in 2017. Lost credibility after that for me
"It's a cruel, uncaring universe we live in. Fingers crossed things won't completely fall apart for them."

I see BOTW and now I'm waiting for a group of grown men to watch shitty old movies.
They’re not just investments. They’re deliberately exploitative and China’s not operating in good faith

I'm going to blow your fucking mind. I dip my Hawaiian pizza in ranch. Booooooooom.
This cut so terribly deep and touched places I had hidden away. I'm at a loss for words.
"It's more like ""Get tinder or any of the apps and get rejected hundreds of times a day"""
That’s exactly what I was thinking but doesn’t it sound super cool?!?
I was surprised the general public hadn't already heard of them tbh. They have been around for quiet sometime.
I cried more here than in Star Wars.
I’m very happy for you! Congrats! 😁
Now that's screwed up. I'm sorry you got put through that :( good on you though for handling it like you did
"It looks like those ""true facts"" memes are coming back, too. SHUT IT DOWN, OTTO."

I enjoy gameplay grind. Don't shoot me lol.

PEOPLE LIKE THING AGGRESSIVELY BE PROUD OF IGNORANCE
Could you make a ten hour version? I’m tired of having to replay this so often
"Look [NAME] is here ""Where the fuck was he an hour ago, gary, where!?"""
this is why she killed herself you sick freaks
"Such a good story. Im now a grown man, crying at work... on reddit."
Self driving cars still won't help fix the problem if old people can't afford them
some one get me a damn barf bag pease !
I play with all 20-24 year old so we most certainly did not hear the punishment on the radio. Not sure exactly where it came from though.
Didn't even realize that the Mazda was a competition. It's always a Camry and Accord.
I find it really strange how people align themselves with or against a politician so strongly.
This was insane. I knew [NAME] was legit when he swung at a pitch while being intentionally walked and almost hit it out.
"He once played the cop too but failed- **his only failed attempt.** *[NAME] a bitch, mayorape-boy!*"

I’ve always heard that the two people you *never* hook up with are exes and roommates. That’s the only bad sounding part of this.
"Congratulations, go for a beer and watch a Leaf game on Saturday! HNIC."
Wait is this a euphemism for ditching your husband and finding a new partner or did you lose 179 pounds?!?!
I'm not looking for pity or sorrow. Thanks for your input.
"Bro, this is not what this sub is for."
"Wow dad, you took a baptismal for me"
My imaginary friend is always busy. I never get to do anything with him eigher :(
I don’t think you even know what you are talking about yourself
"I'd be happy for them to take a shot at him, I think he's an excellent player and only getting better."

"I just came home, what the fuck is this lineup? I love you [NAME] you mad bastard !!!"
It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
The card game in Episode 2 is probably the happiest [NAME] has been in a while.
This is not a good formation. We’ve been over this. It just ends up being crossed lobbed into the box by [NAME]
That'd be amazing! Heard about Newington's reno not long ago. Need to get over there.
Thank you! I was wondering what to do tomorrow morning. Now I have something to go to.

"I hate that attitude, as if it's every woman's, purpose, dream, and personal duty to reproduce."
Implying there was a shootout in the restaurant? I wouldn’t feel safe at all if I were caught in crossfire
Also i think that person is really shitty and I’m sorry you experienced that. People are animals sometimes.
Can't stand people who spam their terrible youtube channels
Being a jerk and believing yourself to be right or the victim creates a messy mind.
"No, I'm saying they are equally critical."
"It's my birthday today, so thank you, I guess? I hope something nice happens to you too."
My dad wears that sweater every game day! It’s in much worse condition however

Oh my gosh! I subscribed to both! Thank you so much for the recommendation.

Sorry I dropped mine can I have another?
I personally think it should be illegal to let unsecured people ride in the back of your Bakkie. That section should only be for goods.
I can appreciate that but snitches get stitches unfortunately
"I LOVE IT, I would love if they will make season 2... I really enjoyed it"
I'm sorry to hear this. I hope you can find something to make you feel happy in the new year.
Unfortunately no one usually fights for their rights without a martyr

Our federal budget is $4 trillion. Until entitlements are reformed the arguments over what things cost is irrelevant.

To me the toenails is the grossest part! 🤮
I unironically agree with everything on the left side of this.
Her comments are disgusting. Reminds me of my mother. I'm so sorry.
"Also, he never gets hurt so you can't Robidas the guy. "

"was i replying to you, you fucking degenerate? off yourself ( in game ofc )"

It happens so much that it really scares me tbh.

Dopey may is still relevant. Delors is not. So your comparison falls flat. Do try keep up.
I knew a guy named [NAME]. Always wondered what his middle name was.

>Star centre [NAME] in the leadership group Oh my
They do not need to. A majority of the vox populi think like you do.
I apologize for my error. I'm not currently up to date on my regional flip flop styles.
"Lol, same! Except that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder"
I’m not an Aub man. Check the flair.
[NAME] are not the best at being subtle about being incels...
This is not a comedy subreddit. It is a subreddit about the unexpected.
Wow that’s weird. I’m too used to that age group complaining about “kids these days”. Thanks for sharing.
I still think hating [NAME] isn't a good move for them. Could turn those undocumented [NAME] into undocumented [NAME].
I got bit by a Pomeranian while doing a dash...
"Trust me, you can anthropomorphize anything and fuck it. Or at least, that’s what the internet has taught me."
[NAME] is hot garbage on that court. He has been the biggest disappointment of any player this season.

How fortunate you're able to whine about it without being censored...
Legend says he still can't believe he's done this.
Yikes - I'm so sorry things fell apart for you and imposing a sudden hierarchy on you like that was completely crappy on their part.
I saw this entire movie on YouTube and loved it! But it doesn’t seem to be on YouTube anymore :/
Too bad it's only good enough to fool dumb animals or animals with poor eyesight
[NAME] was the same in Crestwood. Scary as hell.
"Oh man, when HQGs gets on a roll it’s so good."
Sir that is a popular opinion. I'm too afraid of what sort of trade will happen to want one.
This is a new complaint I haven't seen before... I like it.
"I might be missing a joke myself, but woosh."
"You mean *colloquia?*? You guessed wrong, it's my third language."

I'm enjoying the witty comments but anyone want to throw in some analysis?

He looks like some super imposed [NAME] face (from dumb and dumber) onto a kneecap.
"I think it's the pass rush and that nobody can stay healthy and, but it could be [NAME]. He's not the greatest"
"The fact that you are questioning it, makes it even more worrysome. "
I'm sorry I imagine that was devastating.
I feel like they're blaming the school for them doing exactly the right thing.
"Mate you are mental, no way [NAME] would mess up like you have said!"
He told you that he hates your friends because they don't beat you up? That is so disgusting!
"If my team lost like that, I’d definitely be very upset. Just hard to see it."
"Nah, according to OPs limited post history, he's a pedophile. "
"Hh yeah, not comfortable posting about that atm though ^^; it was quite recent when we split-"
When you're accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression.
I was wondering this too. Whatever it was it's over now.
No way society should pay for your child when you are perfectly capable.

Wow he wants people to donate so he can make a large profit off his atm? Lmao Good gig if you can get it I guess...
Got married so I don't have to worry about it.

"Its an mlm in disguise, branded to appeal to the college demographic. I got the fuck out "

Get your daughter into therapy. That is some crazy manipulative shit she went through.
I always wondered where it was on ormond. I managed to find the toolbox last week on yamaoka as killer.
Quit being racist. They're just being racists.

WOW THATS SO INTERESTING It happens to me so often that when I hear a new word I anticipate it but it all makes sense now
Yep never understand why just because a move is small that makes it bad?
Oh you mean a documentary he produced? I watched it and it felt kinda bias imo
Easy answer - nobody knows. And knowing my country we will probably leave it to the last possible moment and then have an “oh shit” moment.
We’re not upset. We’re disgusted. You’re disgusting.
"Many great years in these jerseys, would love to see them come back as our 3rds with the 1970s originals for the 50th Anniversary season"
Oh my god. Don't you know it's illegal to share memes if you don't have an IQ of 16 trillion?

"you can please some of the people, some of the time, but you can't please all of the people, all of the time..."
Thank you! Well put I am not the best at putting my thoughts into words so well said thank you that was the point I was going for!
Yep. I’m an introvert with a big group of friends. I get tired even after spending just an hour with friends sometimes.
Yes. I hate everything that has to do with my depression.
This grammar is horrible. Discovering something is a fixed single point in history which should have been simple past “was” instead of “had been.”
"as a kpop stan and a army, i am very disappointed"
It is a racist nickname because you're literally using the man's race as a means to criticize him.
Or maybe it was because the government can't collect the tax on it

Wow those latkes look even worse than I thought they would.

I would suffer a heat stroke or die of diarrhea
The Broadway store was popular too. I get that it's regulated now but it's a shame.
Statute of limitations was up by the time I had a backbone
"Oh wow, that's interesting! Genesis is a pretty interesting take on the luxury car market, hope the brand succeeds!"
its not even illegal for like siblings and parents/children to have sex as long as they are adults and consenting when the relationship begins.

muh racist history! its all gone! no one will ever know about my slavery and being a traitorous vermin! help meh!
i feel like this isn't being talked about enough.
Edited because my kneejerk response was kind of unnecessarily harsh. :/
that is not true. I often shoot the rifle round the blast 2 shots from the double barrel. Unless it got changed recently.
"Rejection always hurts, even just a little. Sparing her feelings may mean she doesn't get the meaning. Be direct, kind, but direct. "

If your waifu was real she would never love you

Man I jave never heard such a load of horseshit.
I mean you can want a break from something and still enjoy it.
The Tommy Gun as a crate weapon! Just the worst feeling.
I'm still not not going if I've got somewhere else to not go.
Who the hell has reddit in anything other than dark mode ??
That's what I'm afraid of but I don't have a lot of free time so it would never work.
I’m surprised that any of this is considered that big of a deal. At least he wasn’t molesting little kids.

Problem is that picture is there before you ever set foot in the cabin; [NAME] put it there. Just makes it creepy.
I don't think fantasy draft has been a thing for a few years in career mode.
This is unironically the worst trade I've ever seen.

"He's not a believer, so he doesn't see what he did as wrong. "
"Not sure, can't really feel anything from any other memory that had strong emotional ties "
That it just seems worst now because we have phones (instant media)
That's so disappointing. I'm sorry that happened to you. It really is hard to make friends as an adult.
"I agree with this. I'm extremely happy with the hires, but I think the draft may be a bigger tell tale on how the off-season goes."
The fact that big corporations that made their successes off capitalism are embracing Marxism is really disturbing.
Stoop Kid’s afraid to leave his stoop!
I dont like my rights being restricted on the grounds of race. That is the issue.
Disagree wholeheartedly. I'm actually amazed anyone can think this way.
"For every Undertale or Stardew Valley there's dozens, if not hundreds of other games developers put their heart and soul to, but never catch on."
"Then there you have it. From everything I have seen thus far, this game is doomed. I hate saying that."
"Wait, they banned his mother from travelling too? "
If anything [NAME] has shown he can do a lot with very little. The Bucs are just a fun team to watch
LOL at the tldr. What a crazy story. I'm glad the writer got some friendly new relatives out of it.
Surprised he's in. Imagined he was concussed. He was on another planet for a bit.
Denver will pay for bus fare so homeless people can come live here And we love it! That's where the tents come from!
CBA's app is atrocious. I had to set it up on my mother's new iPhone and it was a nightmare.
Doesnt mean it's scary for everyone. I've taken it twice and have had zero symptoms.
Your girlfriend is cruel and emotionally manipulative. Get the hell out and don’t let anyone else treat you like a dirty little secret again.
"I actually didn’t know that the White House Mess existed, is run by the Navy, and still running. That just makes this even weirder."
"Like it was over wayyyyy too fast for a real one. Shit, the Taliban lasted for years, and ISIS is still a huge problem."
"Oh, hey what's up dude? Haven't seen you around in a while bro. Glad to see your still here."
"[NAME], you're back! And still posting the same old editorialized political garbage, I see. Some things never change."
I have 1200 hours and the highest i’ve ever been was silver elite. I should probably quit this game.
Doesn't surprise me someone this uneducated would choose to inform the government they are evading taxes.
"Sorry for bringing up so many problems without any solutions, and sorry for just being whiny overall. Thanks for the time you've spent talking with me"
"First I was afraid, I was petrified..."
"No, instant transmission is only to places you've been and people you know"
As a contractor this is a huge nono. If it's not on paper it not on your wall either.
"We tried, the place I go is just a rundown old town trashy high school filled with kids who have the background to shoot the place up"
I think you may just be an asshole/moron bud... sorry.
There’s no room for subtleties. This is a consensual nation.
I love this. It's not always the most exciting things that make for the most amazing feelings 😊
Having fun fighting that strawman? Let me know when you're done.
Wtf the dude is 29? Seemed like only yesterday he was the most hyped goalie prospect in the world...
... and no one seemed to care Except that lonely woman with white hair
"I'm so glad [NAME] finally got her visa, she's going to do awesome living in the USA!!!!"
"It would hilarious, but also kind of sad."
"And it should be drenched in blood. It’s supposed to be scary, that’s how you know [NAME] loves you!"
I feel that nobody cares and nothing will be different because this is a total non issue for vast majority of people.
He’s been going to a restaurant for 40 years and forgot what it looked like and where it was.. uh huh.
Seriously? Where the fuck did that sink come from?
Yes I was feeling bad that hes friends left him
I haven’t actually watched it. Who got featured?
Doesn't change the fact that the Lions weren't in a position to get him because they had too much money tied up in their QB.
This dude live near me. All my highschool classmates are big fans of his and look up to him.
Are you like a little baby or what. That's nothing in the realm of fetichism.
The sad truth is that all the feelings you get are real and genuine in that moment
Middle Eastern here and watching this team lose due to silly mistakes at 3-4 am kills me
i never thought i would read the phrase 600 lb cinematic universe but i am glad i did
[NAME] - OT3 in my team without me... [NAME] - Sometimes bad things just happen...
"> Society usually paints men as emotionless, cold, and self sustaining creatures who don't need affection. Not really, though."
I got a girl's number at work and we're dating now so all girls aren't like this lol
Last time I tried exposure at the grocery store I ended up with eight weeks community service.
Yeah thats gucci man. You wander off into needy territory if she says no and you pester and beg her.
Is it bad if I didnt even know he was on waivers....
No room. Get lost. I cc u!
Haha well thank you so much! You've been the only person to say that
So [NAME] proved that they are not literally selling their workers into sex slavery. That's a pretty low bar!!
I’m constantly surprised that [NAME] doesn’t hate her.
Wow I had no idea all of this transpired. Crazy!
Because I have no self-control and I hate myself.
"I am so terribly sorry you lost your dad to this horrendous disease. Judging by this photo, he had a terrific smile."
"I'm the first one, so that's wrong. Party affiliation =/= political leaning"
"Well, glad I could help. Have a fantastic day and don’t let the straights scare you away!"
I’m happy. Does that mean I can downvote?
"I think it's because he was so damn happy for his friend, which again, is sweet as hell."
Which is stupid because conversations about race and slavery in America are primarily about race in slavery in America.
Despite how much the Liberals and NDP apparently hate each other they really do work well together.
I never said it was irrelevant. I am trying to add on to what the OP had said for potential savings.
"The fact that this podcast isn't called ""Z-Targeting Dio's Balls"" disappoints me greatly."
It only gets worse kiddo. Someone call [NAME] and get this girl an upgrade.
Well that's because you're close-minded. But meh. I don't need your respect. ;)
nah he only had one good year really
"That’s fair, I disagree with you, but I’m not here to change your mind. Was just curious. "
As much as I hate [NAME] I love the guy a lot
I skipped the Oilers game for a birthday party for a cat. I’m glad I did that instead.
We're well past the demoralization phase. You're 20 years too late. The left has morphed into something unrecognizable now :(

[NAME] gives me the weirdest boner. I love these guys
"I might be missing a joke myself, but woosh."
I'm flying home to stl tonight. Land at 8pm. Have to get all the way down 44.....fuck.
He appeals to the conversation. Basically doesn’t have a firm stance on anything of much importance and will flip flop based on his guest.
"In like 5 years, your entire high school career will be one entire cringe. Congratulations. "
I tried to write a cheque for a fare when I was a teenager. That did not go down well.
TIL cheddar cheese didn't originate in the U.S. Thank you!
I wonder what a hug would feel like a lot too.
What the hell was that pass. That was magical
Try painting a penis around the pothole. Seems to have worked in Manchester
My husband and I have been circling the drain for years. :(
"How dare you interrupt the circle jerk. Out, sir."
"They’re not exactly tiny creatures. Patch that hole up, my dude."
You people are awful. Those are *Haggisus Australis*. They're a protected species!
Damn it. Don't mention [NAME]. Just makes me sad thinking what could have been.
I just heal and when we start to do bad day its my fault taking blame off of our flanks and frontlines
What happens when a Jedi gets PTSD? Play this game to find out. Hint: ITS FUCKIN BAD NEWS SON
I'm also enjoying it I like mixing the colors the most.
Need to go middle of the road no [NAME] is going to vote for [NAME].
Sadly I had to scroll through the story to read this
"I think he means he had an ""a ha"" moment."
Always gotta have a scapegoat so your chosen economic ideology doesn't look bad!
Not what this sub is for and this doesn't make you look like a good person but ok
It was received on Jan 25th at 9:22 am .81627 BTC and $3800. for it with a $600. fee. Happy!
"That’s the p-value, not the effect size. 0.4 is a long way from being a significant result."
"[NAME] was pretty rude to the maintenance guy too, but what a comeback he had for [NAME]!"
I agree about that hill and visibility. Why they put that Starbucks in a poorly accessed place is beyond me.
It surprises me that he's a mod some days...
"Too bad ""incremental change toward reasonable goals via evidence-based policy"" doesn't work well on a bumper sticker"
"Hence what I said, it is just as illegal yesterday as it is today ... literally nothing changed "
"exactly how i feel about it too. the guy is just a jerk, and can't be bothered to care unless it benefits him. selfish little prick"
I would change the episode with Icicle. Get rid of the cold puns. Everything else can stay the same
"My husband’s mental health issues caused our divorce. If you need a friend or a listening ear, pm me. I hope things improve!"
Had to stop and wonder what [NAME] has to do with this before I realize you wrote dumpster
"Yeah , yeah you can’t change my mind , you’ll get there eventually ."
"Honestly after he was so reasonable and calm throughout this confrontation, the hatchet man tattoo made me chuckle. Definitely unexpected."
"Nah, I’m good, just trying to help you out. Have a good one"
This is the worst I've ever seen. It really is
It takes her a week to decide? I highly doubt it. If she was interested she would've agreed immediately.
"Vanity is a sin, [NAME] wants us to hate our bodies"
But shouldn't that money go *back to Connecticut*. We don't lack problems.
My shirt is [NAME]. My balloon popper is the DNC. And then [NAME] is the fire under my ass to dive deeper ever day.
"As much as he's a bit of a nutter, he does keep his word as far as I can tell."
Don't make me cry...P.S. Happy cake day!
"When *[NAME]* has to talk you out of an idea, you know you've got to rethink how you're living your life."
Unfortunate that her knee never rose to the occasion
"[NAME] you sound like my father, I feel sorry for you"
"I mean, you're the one rationalizing for what essentially amounts to a presidential dictatorship."
"By pushing misleading and false information, your agenda is dividing [NAME]."
"I'm glad for that. Once that check comes in, I only have about $3000 to work with."
FWIW I had a terrible series of experiences at CFA and would never recommend anyone with anxiety go there.
"I can't believe people are saying [NAME] should have been saved, she knew like 10% of the words"
They killed me [NAME]. They killed me with schlock
They got ripped apart here (On Reddit) a few weeks ago for passing false information on aircraft videos and taking legit criticism poorly.
Some judges are just literally scum. Have those in Germany aswell. Unfortunately.
Thanks I was worried that I might die alone
"Oh, I would refuse to do anything really nasty, with profanity or violence."
Tuck her in and give her a kiss on the forehead
"For art? I think it's kind of silly, but it's also fun. Let people live :P"
Yaaaaah haha objectively they're not GREAT movies 😅
"Yeah I cannot either on mobile, same with enough internet. Thoroughly disappointing."
Glad you came to your senses. Go feel uncomfortable about Lola bunny in Space Jam again.
"Sorry, yes they do. [NAME] is the worst QB mentioned in that list."
Good to see [NAME] getting some love.
Happy birthday!! Lots of love and hugs from a stranger in Hanoi 🤗🤗
I punch them in the throat before they get the chance to speak.
Randomly watched arrow this week and I think each year is more confusing and I didn't like it! At least [NAME] is still there and always shining!
[NAME] is just another millionaire taking advantage of dumb people.
This was the most fun I've had watching a game since [NAME] 35 point game
So sorry to hear about your abnormal growth. I'm now green with envy. Are there other celestial gods that can identify with existence?
He’s just jealous that we can get our coal liner straight from the source. NEXT!
I got banned on an old account for no discernible reason months after I had last posted there.
Mate she looks like a feckin quality street
"Ugh, he sounds like a slob and you should leave him."
I doubt [NAME] could do make up as well as a drag queen. He's not really good at anything.
"I was also terribly confused. I’ll jump on and play with you sometime, working tonight unfortunately."
"Lol that sucks. It's 80.9 in Vegreville, 84.4 at a Costco, or pretty much between 85-89 cents everywhere in Edmonton and area."
Same. About as Libertarian as fucking [NAME].
Make sure to tell her /r/Austin helped you pick a place! She'll appreciate the thought you put into choosing a place special to her.
Sitting down and wiping is disgusting. Especislly when using a public toilet. Fucking savages up in this thread.
same but with cats. Puppies are really high maintenance and make me angry when i have to take care of them.
Oh man this is horrible and the best summary of this subreddit in one single comment. I love it. Thank you so much.
Still is glitched to this day.... sad
Happy birthday and I'm really glad I won't be feeling like you when you wake up tomorrow
No actually my therapist is amazing! I've just had bad experiences with doctors in the past. I meant I'm worried the doctor will say that.
"This was so helpful! Thank you. I really needed to hear something inspiring for once, instead of just hearing that I’m not doing enough."
I'm upset that there's no sexual subtext between [NAME] and [NAME] in the new Super Mario game
"They just keep coming, it's like a cartoon"
We're in it... and now [NAME] is going to the bench? Gotta good feeling!
Just seems a little much for -40 downvotes. Seems like people are offended. I just don't get it
Hot take: [NAME] sucked after he went away to anger management and he suddenly changed into a moron who was completely incapable of doing anything even remotely correct.
And Meteor Man Edit: Hancock was a superhero movie too even though it was terrible.
"As a risk analyst, that's a terrible idea, Risk is too high and the benefit to cost ratio is not worth it "
>the silent majority This is the most ignorant thing I've read so far today
I promise you it would for most people. You're just spoiled with having the mountains 45 minutes away.
"I literally teared up reading this. That poor, poor guy. He has a great attitude, but that's heartbreaking."
I am not expecting this to be an easy task... 😬
Are you daft ... ? That is and always has been the proposal. [NAME] don't listen and don't care though. Fucking dumbass.
So? Many people don’t resemble their parents.
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU’RE TALKIN’ TO ME!
I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
>[NAME] One of the most horrifying stories I've ever heard of: the mom should be in psychiatric care and the doctor thrown in jail IMO.
Going to my favorite greasy burger place in Madison tonight to celebrate my ability to eat delicious burgers whenever I want because I'm in my early 20's
"All the signs, except his username, seemed legit. I also clicked. Now I just want to forget all about what I've just seen..."
He gave his 20 year old ex herpies dumped her and she killed herself. He’s an awful person
I didn't realize there was ever an initial post on this subject.
I just hope the Cavs don’t get the 1st pick fuck them
Definitely not a dead human body. He’s probably just a weird dude that has some weird thing in his room that smells terrible.
[NAME] is Television. Got it. He's too misogynistic to be the Patti Smith Group.
I dislike [NAME] more and more. Big ego and small feet.
"[NAME], for when you want to be a healer but also want a FUCK EVERYONE AROUND ME button. Although I’ve been maiming [NAME] recently."
This will either be a classic or a complete shitshow
okay glad you have bots cause whoops
It's hard to be good to yourself.
"Yeah, surely this is *exactly* what democracy is? "
"Sadly, he seems immune to bans. He also dodges them with alts like [NAME]"
OMG the bra hanging out of the back of that dress is so cringe.
Sorry man [NAME] doesnt care about hard working [NAME]. Sad
I would vote no to a United Ireland because the Republic doesn't have a free health service and no free prescriptions
"Oligarch-sponsored? [NAME], stop throwing buzz words at ideas you don't agree with. Read a book."
This primary doesn’t deserve this nice birthday.
I don't think you've ever seen the dsm. If you knowingly do something stupid you don't deserve anything but what you get
"Sorry pal, it’s actually one of my least favorites :/"
In this day and age I’m actually surprised at how many hotels haven’t sorted plugs by the beds yet
What he said is entirely untrue fyi
Wow he wants people to donate so he can make a large profit off his atm? Lmao Good gig if you can get it I guess...
[NAME] had a record for not scoring goals for several matches in a row with [NAME] as coach. Never mind that [NAME] was pretty awful during his time at Porto.
"Yeah, the death of pharmaceutical producers seems like a weird thing to root for."
> I’m tired of being realistic and open minded. Me too! Now it is all about being selfish and aloof. Not even kidding.
I related to [NAME] so much in this moment. I hate that [NAME] gone when he reaches for him.
I know it's like this hipster phrase it's so stupid like you're not from the south you dumb motherfuker.

Yeah it’s the opponents club that should be scared of us! We are REAL MADRID!
After he did the one year contract last year I'm not seeing him staying here with no improvement from our team.
it is dangerous to date men - read the news - women get killed by male partners and ex partners very frequently. Women are amazingly brave.
There’s a special place in hell for u
[NAME] that was so awful I collapsed into a singularity
> a central bank that acts as a buffer between monetary policy and implementation. ... what?
It is though. Certainly the worst Zelda game at least.
Why everyone mad i think it was a joke .people these days over sensitive my [NAME].
"I'm so stupid, I can do this. On accident. so not very well."
God [NAME] can't come back fast enough. I don't know if the fans in the rest of the league realize how big his loss is
We cant say dodgeball these days. It’s forbidden. Like how we call anal sex “Lawyer love” now.
"I want to see that too, but we all know it's not going to happen."
"I never said they were garbage, just that they come out too frequently."
Aw bummer. She lost her screenshot of the copy of a copy of bullshit articles handwritten in 1992. Somebody help a girl out.
"Hope you enjoy it! Try not to leave it too long though, it's been taken down before. "
Skypeia in One Piece has literally nothing to do with the main plot but I loved it. It also gave us the single greatest reaction image.
Daaang [NAME] lost weight!!!! Is she making a comeback?
"Yeah, I'm happy to help an actual friend in need, but not some distant acquaintance ""friend""."
"Honestly, I respect [NAME] for doing what he felt was best for business. [NAME] can go fuck himself."
Just keep going and don't lose hope. Stuff like this can happen all the time to anybody. It's just bad luck
You’re trash april. I’m November 2000 actually. Damn we’re old.
And wr is not what I want us to focus on anyways. We got plenty of other needs
That’s not very cash money of you
And fake papers are probably dwarfed by genuine but bad papers. So what?
My biggest problem with Yuri on Ice is that it didn't have enough episodes to show the payoff of their relationship in my opinion.
Just saw your history. Makes complete sense now. Your a trumptroll. Bye.
"When you've been dodging as much as [NAME] has, to this challenge, ppl start to 2nd guess and lose faith in you."
I don't like sleeping in the couch :(
I doubt groot arms are on the list of MLB approved bats. It's politics
"It's the ""boyfriend around school haha jk"" thing that makes it weird."
Drive thru is the worst. The number of times people would sneeze in my face at the window was infuriating.
Anything that moves us away from the 5 man push meta on SnD. Playing SnD without stuns and nades hasn’t felt right.
> Waaah the reward I get for being a decent human being isn’t good enough.
I’d love for [NAME] to turn into prime [NAME]
Not even polite if they're driving. The road rage here is terrifying.
Seems like you jerk off looking at mirror while you’re crying
The cheerfulness of the “hail satan” text overlay was unexpected.
At least you can admit you value one innocent person's life over another. What a shock it's the rich politician over the security guard.
Ugh... hate when people talk to me when I'm fishing. This would be so awful hahaha
"Really? Wow. You’re either hopelessly ignorant or you’re trolling. For your sake, I hope you’re trolling."
Poor [NAME]. One of the great men of our time getting destroyed by the courts. I hear he has to file for bankruptcy.
Cross posting is a thing.. I'm not subscribed to /r/funny so I wouldn't have seen it had they not.
I'm sorry. I hope he takes the CTJ talk seriously. Fingers crossed for you!
Not true for a lot of people but [NAME]
it made me cry too when [NAME] return to her older self😢
Getting tougher to make those mortgage **and** car payments.
I'm moving to the UK in 2 weeks. This terrifies me.

She is probably cheating on you. :(
No way a tattooed ex-con with a drug/drinking problem might turn abusive!
Bein' separated just doesn't feel so right.
same but with cats. Puppies are really high maintenance and make me angry when i have to take care of them.
"Through mutual friends, and online forums. I find out most online shooters are more fun when playing in a party and able to chat."

I can guarantee you for many the hate for this administration started much before the election results were in.
I went to the avenues once. I was murdered twice in one day and they stole my grandma's jewellery from her grave in Minnesota!
Looking at this hurts my teeth but dot damn those roses look so pretty
"Said it all year, I think losing [NAME] hurt this team in more ways than we'll ever know. "
"I've tried a whole lot of things, nothing has worked."
They could not have done the same thing. Only certain things can go in a reconciliation bill.
Haha I didnt even notice. I guess it does.
"It says new, but I feel like they should call it 'used.'"
He also says something about waking up from a nap in his gameplay reveal calling it a “pain in my ass”
"Should have drafted [NAME] and then never traded for THJ...Anyways, just happy we got [NAME] out of this finally."
I would like to see the after justice of idiots like this
The first comment wasn't but when you not wanted you should just fuck off
Ikr. Spend your time doing better things like reading [NAME] fanfics ❤️
Oh you know they’re BOTH going for it.
That might’ve been the worst pass he’s ever thrown. Yikes
It would bother me so much to be so dependet from a Person. I am sure there is a way you can go without a person sponsoring You.
Using Vtrigger and Vskill buttons!? Oh My.
Lol. What a great way to start off the morning
If only there was a league of sorts of higher ranked play that they could watch. Oh well.
And why are they trolling i. The first place? Care to exain the reason?
The stressors of the hotel industry are much the same as a restaurant. It doesn't appeal to me
you can't really see the shitty comments on youtube. On instagram it's much easier
Imagine your daughter running away from home. I think that's a pretty terrifying idea without some murderer or mystic horror

Damn. That’s profound. Did you graduate from Harvard?
"I mean it makes sense, they're into [NAME] because they totally dig the horribly socially stunted types so they love [NAME] for horribly traumatizing her."
That explains an awful lot about ICP.
"yeah guys, stop complaining about violent mobs and join one!"
I skimmed poorly and thought it said 4 people (independently) discovered their data was accessed
The left solution is to make them all citizens and to buy their votes with welfare and to never lose an election again as they destroy America.

"He sees you when you’re tweeting, He knows that you’re a fake, He knows that you love [NAME] So resign for goodness sake. "

2019 should just be a picture of a trash can or dumpster on fire. Amazing how shitty DICE can make things in 10 years.

"I really get that, it's soooo disappointing. I hope he can make it up to you."
[NAME] what a piece of shit! How could you do that to an animal?!
I’m proud of you and I’m happy for you!
Wanting America to be better does not mean hating America. We can do better than [NAME]. He’s an embarrassment to the entire country.
except for the implication that white colonialism saved the native population from barbarism
"But atacking it over and over again is considered griefing, you wanted to shoot fishes in a barrel over and over and got caught."
We just had a teacher do that at my school. I don't know who wiped the kids butts though
"Middle guy doesn't look to fit to me. Looks like me, too many pounds."

"the trajectory of that is really weird! But [NAME], that guys arm, hand, possibly head is not liking the next .01 second!"

It's nothing on you. I just hate the idea from a justice standpoint. I strive for fairness as much as I'm able.
"Sanctions are immoral and don't do anything but cause more human suffering, disappointing to see that this sub will support them, but not really a shock. "
I’m amazed how anti-government these people are. They have no understanding of what government does. Perhaps they should move to Somalia. No government there.
Holy shit. Those guys are scumbags. I'm so sorry you had to go through such an awful roleplay.
The comments on this thread are what I expected and that makes me sad.
"I mean, okay...I don't support those so-called ""religious liberty"" laws, soo...there's that."

"I've tried a whole lot of things, nothing has worked."
"True dat, I lost hope a LONG time ago"
I met [NAME] and he actually DID give me 40 dollars...I worked at a movie theater near where he lives and he bought snacks.
It surprises me that he's a mod some days...
"Yes, I've had this fear. It's even worse when you *don't* say goodbye and then it's the last time you see them."
Well that’s sad. It might’ve been funny if it was fake.
Everyone is a little toxic inside. I feel like killers being toxic comes from survivors being toxic and vice versa. It's a vicious cycle.
"She got more votes tho... If popular vote determined the winner, you wouldn't say this. You sound like you just hate [NAME] for... reasons?"
That’s not a very humble opinion at all.
You can buy bitesize toad in the holes in Tesco. They are amazing. These look like they use hotdogs but I imagine would be almost as good.
The emoji at the end just made me want to slap her
"Uhhhh, existed... Ever been to Arkansas? It’s boring as fuck."
"What makes it a non sequitur? The point is, just because someone is in the DSA doesn't mean they are a *democratic* socialist"
The titles of her posts are somewhat dramatic and I have avoided her because of that
"Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad."
I'm guessing they give up garbage time scores alot when they have the win in hand.
As a Dolphins fan this hurts me

I don't think this makes much sense for Sacramento.
You’re only as young as you feel 😄
One day I was really desperate and tried putting warming balms that are intended for sore muscles on my lower tummy and it helps so much!
Ouch. That hurt the ego. And that’s not easy to do.

You mean 0.08 - at 0.8 you'd be dead about twice over
Sweet! This just keeps getting better. Have a good one
No. The Office wouldn't exist today due to liberalism and everyone being offended for everyone else.
I do the 4-second gap as well and is it infuriating to see someone take advantage of it.
I thought it was 'You are only willing to help yourself'. I could be wrong though.

Someone with erectile dysfunction already can't (conventionally) orgasm. What the fuck are you talking about?
I can't upvote this enough. Thank you for practicing what is preached!
Would love to if I wasn't sitting here writing a 40 page report for work.
This just makes me feel inferior at this point.
I'm sorry but as someone who travels alone I would be pissed if I was told I can't drink at the bar by myself.
I honestly couldn’t care what you think of me random person on the internet.
They can't they need a morty dumbness shield
"The problem they have is... They ""knew"" [NAME] would win."
I've never read an article that made me experience both disgust and schadenfreude in equal measure like this one has.
fuck I meant to put a never in there. I'm glad you picked me up on this before I got put on a subreddit.
Not really. Everyone has different thoughts about kids and I don’t see it as appeasement.
[NAME] a fucking idiot and needs to be primaried out.
I'm so surprised they haven't done it yet tbh!
And [NAME] should go sell his wife's ketchup. He's good for nothing else besides selling out our country.
"WTH?! Sorry, but you might need better friends! That is wrong. So wrong. "
When your 16 and do adderall and get a panic attack
It continually amazes me how many people don't understand this.
They didn't play it safe. They played it big and failed hard. The plot is too damn big for a soft-reboot game.-* +
He also needs to understand it’s insanely hard to empathize with multimillionaires playing a kids game asking for hundreds million more.
"I wake up in a cold sweat at four am on a Tuesday like ""table twelve never got their ranch three Fridays ago"" "
Watching it deteriorate into a horrific dystopia. Healthcare costs. Dental. Low wages.

"The Morton hockey team train there, if the football moved down maybe we’d have success"
Damn i guess people shouldn't steal. Or smoke
Well who knows what valve thinks. I don’t like Lyrical and Maut either.
Yet *I* get banned for saying you should downvote posts you don’t like. Fml
Dude alcohol is literally poison and talking about tryna self medicate?

I am so happy that sub exists
"Honestly I don't celebrate any holidays including new years, and whatnot. "

Yess! Some of my favorite lines from the trilogy. [NAME] killing joke monologue still seems very relevant today.
Enough food to feed the whole village just wasted
We have laws against all that. Get the police to do take action.
Oh the pain. I have been gifted faulty genes that gave me humongous pores and a hairy upper lip. Only a miracle can save me from here.
Just get in front of him and stop
"All those empty seats smh. Imagine paying $300+ just to see the Rangers get slaughtered at home. And yet, I still want more goals haha."
I'm sad I had to come this far down to find this.

"It would be mostly home-grown terrorism, angry at all the people fleeing from overseas terrorism."
If men were that aggressive we’d be arrested and then slammed publicly and socially. Lives ruined for a moment of drunken stupor.

Have I been eating avacodos wrong this entire time! Oh no!
What a beautiful memory for you to have found. So sorry for your loss ❤️
"Well, at least she broke up first. It would somehow be worse if she kept it hidden and brought him the news later"
I think it was roughing and unsportsmanlike conduct for the chirp or something stupid like that. I couldn't believe [NAME] got away with that
"Honestly nothing, death is an awful part of life. The only thing that can do anything is time. Just never forget them."
Oh boy do I have some bad news for you!

“The weird thing is she’s got a tattoo of our company on her back...” lmfao
Pull your fucking pants up oh my god
"And my apologies if I misinterpreted but you seemed to state multiple times that it keeps you from seeking other women, such as the [NAME] example."
SJW's I've encountered were far more trivial and spiteful in general.
"Thank you. Yeah it's a nice thought, being sheltered and happy before any worries or drama. It would be nice..."
[NAME] was actually wrong all along. JAH > Jokic /s
"I know, i read that previous post. Im just worried about your parrot getting injured because of that woman :/"
"Ok. Progress. Not only I presented more facts, I also asked some questions. Still unanswered, sadly. "

Shouldn't have drank water from his cup.
"i dunno, you commit one little genocide and you never hear the fucking end of it"

But I hate trannies and feminsts owo

Uhhh... unfortunately I can't read the article due to some regulations...but pretty sure that post is just the article
I was going to say is there even such a sensor? Turns out there is...
It's good if you hate workers and love pollution
What can you expect from guys who think everything based on sex and romance is solely based on a person’s looks and not at all their personality?
Agreed. How do you feel about the rumors that he doesn't pick any girl as an endgame?
this off season is dark and full of terrors
Two goals that are directly the fault of the our defense? I feel bad for [NAME]
"To be fair, we’re still missing CP3 and [NAME]. This game has been pretty ugly overall though. "

My pleasure ☺️ hope you enjoy! She seems very sweet.
Someone with erectile dysfunction already can't (conventionally) orgasm. What the fuck are you talking about?
I don’t know why but watching this makes me super happy!
No that would be yet another mistake.

Rightfully so. I had it as a child and it was the worst experience in my life. I'm also vulnerable for shingles now. Yaaay.
" anyone who hasn't seen this, it's unbelievably bad."
People really spend more than $10 in an app game? I mean an actual video game I can understand but that's just...sad
"Yeah I didn't like getting clawed from that far away. IF it has that big of a hitbox, it shouldn't be that far reaching"
I rise my next one to Zero. The one after that to your happiness.
A 12 million sub channel has value. Wouldn't be surprised if it's been hollowed out ready to be sold and rebranded.
[NAME] ! Glad that we helped you.
Yes it is. But from what I've read it sounds like it was after the testimony and not one of the charges against him.
[NAME] and his supporters are the dumbest humans in the fucking galaxy. They should be locked up for their own safety.
Imagine thinking this comment was ok to post. Shame on you.
"I mean, they called you ugly either way. It's not like they change their mind if you don't take the money."
The men that you grew up around sound pretty insensitive. I hope that they didn’t cloud your opinion of what a typical man is like.
"Yeah, this is always my first thought when I read this kind of stuff, kinda sad to be honest "
"But then they couldn't be a self-martyring, violent tankie and that's not as much fun."

I'm 33 and every year I'm more sure I never want children. I am perfectly happy with my husband and our cats. ❤️
">sentence more severe. Debatable, I'd rather be dead than have everyone think I relentlessly molested kids. "
This is maybe the lamest way you can say that.
They seceded because [NAME] was elected despite not appearing on any slave owning states. How is this anything but under representation of ideology.
Pfft. That's awful of him and her. They deserve each other then. Grab your shite and gtfo. Hope he enjoys his fog and dysfunction.
"Almost like [NAME] culture is written to be offensive, what with the institutionalized rape slaves and everything. They might even be the baddies."

Worried about it escaping....now that's fresh food.
Tell him he should get a divorce.
"No she never told me her name, and I unfortunately never asked for that or her number. "

"The title is a lie. I dislike what the APA is doing as much as anyone else, but how bout we dont sensationalize it."
The original argument was that he said the n word. Now the argument is that he just wanted to say it.
Don't tell me what to do. I'm not going to argue with someone who goes around calling everything bro science.
Fuuuuck. I feel this. In my core.

This is unironically the worst trade I've ever seen.
More than half the US states have them on the books. AIPAC is one hell of a cancerous institution.

It surprises me Turkey doesn't intervene even there. I would presume that at least OB-ES areas are off limits and Turkey would intervene if HTS entered them.
He knows he's not playing as well as he should be. By that logic [NAME] wants out so he should go too.
"Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
Huh. So it really comes down to looking at her senate career vs her AG career.
"Even though [NAME] has had so many drawbacks and made some mistakes, let's make one thing clear: it's NOT a time to trade him."

Middle school. Puberty was rough for most of us. I was a victim and a perpetrator of a lot of stupid behavior in middle school.
Whataboutism then. Some of the worst I've seen at that too.
If you really think a horror movie needs jump scares then I feel bad for you son.

"I go to the same hairdresser as [NAME], and she told me we were interested. Dunno how she got her info though."
"They can try to do that for as long as they want, doesn't change the fact that 2/3rds of players still chose him over [NAME]."
Yea the refs weren't terrible all game or anything
If [NAME] doesn't drop a [NAME] tribute tonight in his intro I'm going to be hella disappointed.
You're just upset because it accurately highlights the absurdity of the minimum wage.

Because [NAME] is a man child who can’t stand up to his mother
I read this while taking a sip of tea. Bad idea
I always get a kick out of the videos posted of cars and buses stuck around that area. Bathurst going up to St. Clair is also notorious.

USC had 4 guys commit 2 fouls in the first half. This might become a war of attrition.
If that pleases you then great but it means nothing to me. I just use it and ill see it properly in game.

Hmmmmm never thought about it like that
Thank you for responding with truth to a top comment that is intentionally very misleading

"Damn, good thing I got those experts to tell me that, I'd never have guessed!"
Didn't even realize that the Mazda was a competition. It's always a Camry and Accord.
That's the biggest annoyance I have with this sub the past year; how little people value [NAME]. I don't get it.
"She thinks you're getting back together. That's what happened. For both you and her, go back to no contact."
Didn't even notice until you *pointed* it out. I had a bit of a giggle.
Running with a gun and a sensor dart out makes me feel so cool.
"as a woman, I can tell ya it’s not uncommon for that to happen, haha. [NAME] make it extra sad though."
The average person here could go their whole life without ever seeing a gun. The gangs and such yeah they manage to get guns one way or another
? sometimes i play ffa with my friends to have fun
"unbridled bigotry that started as a meme but ended... well, it hasn't yet but its not looking good"
Fucking happy this jerk is still well and alive.
OLD can be a dangerous place. Gotta stay safe somehow!
Looks fake as she flinches before the ball hits her.
[NAME] thinks [NAME] for [NAME] is a bad deal for the Bulls.
Too late with having it back. I really did'nt have much back then. So I had a really hard time too.
This is why I have trust issues
Everyone is sad on this sub dont take it personally if you don't get any replies.
Hey mods... let's not allow articles pushing unsubstantiated rumour from poor sources

It isn't called the immortal science for no reason ey
Sad thing is it would probably forcibly ground the plane.
My t levels are normal. Doctor thinks its my low carb diet but I dont buy that

Since they only do 6 a year now I would rather it be somone more exciting and surprising
"I couldn’t believe that. I’ve been mad but never enough to throw my PHONE! GIRL, what is you DOIN’?"
"On [NAME], the allegations and the final result were very different. If I recall most of the complaints substance was rejected or disproven."
AOC has tons of corporate Dollars backing her recent wins. I cant believe anyone would see her as presidential material.

Damn she might have actually had a stroke if she started panicking
"I do that on my boyfriend too haha, super soft and makes me feel safe! Maybe we are all crazy"
"I don't know why he'd take it like that, he was gone for so long so someone was going to do a show like that."

It smelled even worse than it sounds. You learn just how quickly someone's feet can rot and really stink up an entire bay.

"You can, but it won’t do anything for your ugly personality."
"Oligarch-sponsored? [NAME], stop throwing buzz words at ideas you don't agree with. Read a book."
"eh, no. Maybe wood can be an alternative if thon is out of the option, but i will never get the allure behind ersan"
"But she spells oddly well, and these aren't small words. It's a bunch of interrupted/disjointed thoughts. "
That is even worse. No tax from them and we provide them with services.
I just have never found that area very attractive. Also from what I understand there is a lot of contaminated burial sites around there.
I perform nostril waxing. It is surprising hardly painful at all. Feels so much better too!
Mini sun because rain pouring on you constantly will ruin everything around you like electronics
The number of pedos is too damn high!

Surprised Colorado ain’t got one the way things have been going here past couple years
Watt made you think this was funny?
Same. Body hair (on my own body..I don't care what anybody else does with THEIR body hair) grosses me the fuck out.
I'm still worried about [NAME] though :(
I am sorry but you dont have a saying in this matter. Its up to your parents to solve this.
Everything. Everything is wrong with being hypocritical.
"revelation = if you aren't doing it after some major event which you also just learned about, you aren't doing it right."
How dare you assume my mortality! >:O
This is one of the dumbest things I’ve read on reddit this year.
You're championing the removal of some threads while complaining about the removal of threads...
Don't include me in this us! Just kidding.. We need some love and fast.
"Understand their point of view, 13 IS too young. Imagine how they felt when they found out their innocent child was watching adult videos."
I would absolutely hate it if they used it in the games tbh
Just split for gods sake before kids are born.
"I, for one, am glad you didn’t. Happy you’re still with us "
That's wild. I was just at the DIA last week.
I hate roundabouts. For some reason road designers have a fetish for them as more and more are popping up. For cyclist they are rings of death
they already ruined their own lives by having an affair. the other spouse knowing is just a consequence of their selfish actions.
oh I relate. I’ve spent many a hour on that game (;; . _ .)

"This is so sad. [NAME], play 'bitch lasagna'"
LMFAOOOOO that’s when family guy was still funny
"Heard Sale players yelling at the refs and nothing has come of it, seems odd to suddenly have an issue with it"

It would be terrible if he died and they put his head in a jar or something
My comment wasn't aimed at you... try to relax
"It’s still not working unfortunately :(, you have a link to your YT?"
I’m battling depression and anxiety and having a healthy diet and loosing weight has helped me
Omg! That's awesome thank you so much!
I'm surprised that this is still happening despite the threats of an invasion of manbij.
Fuck these trendy hipster joints. Give me my shit like normal fucking people.
Why would you cross while an event is going...
I can barely remember when it was even possible to find shit that horrible
I am vuri disappointed in you. You gained turdy pounds tis munt. Scale dont lie
How many times has this ‘football fan’ committed these crimes now. Someone should lock him up.
I’ve always heard that the two people you *never* hook up with are exes and roommates. That’s the only bad sounding part of this.
Thanks! It is too bad we can't suddenly age [NAME] and [NAME] a year or so.

"Way to cherry pick. Remember that time that [NAME] person got lit up for like, 9 goals against or something? Man, that guy sure sucked."
"Will see,still better for Chelsea then [NAME] who looked completely lost and devoid of any confidence lately"
In combination? Also interaction my Bipolar meds + blood pressure meds almost killed me. I now have very choices in meds.

I know I care about people more than animals... Im a fucking monster.
"Thank you very much. I try my best to follow my steps from therapy, but it seems to be my biggest hurdle."
"Hey, it's working again! Somebody at YouTube must have given the server a whack, because suddenly the recommendations are making sense. I wonder what happened today."
Why aren’t we putting guys in for garbage time?
None that I know of. Any mental health issue needs to be cared for like any other health issue. Doctors and medications can help.
That it just seems worst now because we have phones (instant media)
That damn FDR who America loved so much they had to write an amendment to the Constitution to keep anyone else from being elected that many times

I really hope no one actually thought [NAME] would be our coach for next season.
Life is Strange is terrible. Absolutely zero gameplay...
Man I jave never heard such a load of horseshit.

Get some guns! You very well might need one
"[NAME] just has the runs. Don't worry, [NAME] is lacing up to replace him"
Feeling your pain. I was laid off due to our department closing the week after Thanksgiving. Good luck to you. Stay strong.
They are so old and so predictable that they can NOT see how “silly” they look when they post articles like this......
"Thanks for saying that, but yeah: you really need to do something about your boy there. He’s not right."
It always upset me that [NAME] would require his only son to do this I no longer believe it
No joke. Physics or chemistry I can see but comp 101? I’m surprised he has the ability to find the internet
It was more of a sarcastic ‘lol yeah right’. Nothing funny about wanting to harm my cat or control my life.
"""I don't socialize because i'm unhappy and i'm unhappy because I don't socialize"". -Socially anxious bastard"
"Not good idea, unless you mean ""money"" as gold. She would ruin it with inflation."

That troll and his Kotaku cronies have no shame. None at all.
Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.
This why we can’t have nice things! I would’ve beat him up for taking with my non-existent mans away 😤
That's the most obvious lie I've seen all year...
You don't want a mature discussion. You want to attack children.
Hit up skull forts if you are looking for the fastest way. But just play and have fun.
"Well I'm glad the whole coffee vs beer exchange was the most accurate part of the episode. When it comes to accents, anyway..."

Coincidence..only 2 hours ago I opened a roll of US quarters Ive had for a few months..16 regular pcs...and 24 states quarters. 24..quite happy.

The cult of reason was very unreasonable. :D
"Even if I close the app, mine still pings.. It's maddening"
I dont know this one (new or yet another alt) I can't take people seriously when they have a hidden agenda for these questions
Saw the police and they use an invisible boatcar to get this one is my first heartbreak.

Someone who’s to sad and empty to care about toast... me I guess?
[NAME] fucking christ. When [NAME] came into the league he was pretty much as skinny as [NAME] is now. And look at the dude now.

Ah. Not on either of those. [NAME]! ::goes back to stalking profiles::
"And here I am, with no promotion after 3 years. Anyways, congrats for yours."
Funny way to oppose fascism - since they are themselves fascists
"That, the fact that the photo was taken on someone's phone and the fact they couldn't be arsed to crop it properly..."

"As someone who has been in a similar relationship, it is indeed emotional abuse."
I understand it but still can't ask questions. I am too afraid
I did some social media snooping since I posted this. Turns out they’re both not retired at 25. Go figure.
It's sad that we have to think of it as a miracle and not a regular occurrence :/
Unfortunately residency is never allowed where I am at the moment.
Acne scars unfortunately and also out of anxiety I tend to pick at my skin.
Lmao at this point she’ll probably deliver Teddy/Owen’s baby.

"That used to be my favorite view on the planet, but now it’s just rage. I can’t look anymore."
im glad they have it but this should have really been introduced in DMC3
Pretty sure I’ve seen this. He swings away with the harness he is wearing. Still looks painful but I think he lives
Good to know! I should keep a lookout then.
That’s cool. I didn’t know they had cameras like that. Thank you for sharing :)
Says the guy not replying to any counter points lmao
And yet it looks like one thing you can't is read. Shame shame.
Such a disappointment. Mobile games are such a shallow replacement for a full sequel. What a let down.
Lol well now you have even more in common! So happy to help and hope you can smile a bit before you zzzzzzz. :-)
Lmfao. Omg I’m dead. Please do more of these somehow
Yeah it can feel a bit weird but I feel like Cali girls use dude for guys and girls so it's not an immediate L
This is all the creativity you folks could muster today? Up is down and red is blue? I was hoping for a little more effort. r/terribletrollisterribleattrolling
I think you misunderstood me. I wanted to say that it was beyond stupid 😊

If we were in the same city we could've hung out. Happy new year to you. You're not alone in being alone.
It's shameful that he has to preface this post with his bias. Couldn't just leave well enough alone.
Not terribly many of those jumping fences in the UK I think. :P

Dude it was an old video. Your porn math is way off.
You're never too young to have a Vietnam flashback
That was what our media guys said but he is now 1/3 in the shootout (was 1/2). No clue how they butchered that one so badly.

Really surprised I had to come this far down to find this!
"That face just screams ""Come here little boy, I have a lollipop for you"""
Arizona in the summer is fine. Arizona in the winter when all the blue hair snowbirds come is absolutely horrifying.
Scenes like these are what make me wish I could forget the entire show at will. So I can watch and enjoy them all over again.
The University of Essex was a mistake. They're not even good at sports.
I wasn’t even expecting the reply that’s why I’m literally bamboozled.
This article wasn’t much better. The errors begin in the sixth paragraph. Thanks for sharing though!
Me too. Scorpion sounds so odd now
oh yes! i did not know pizza could possibly ever be disgusting until i moved to florida.
Yeah. I don't even know why I was filming lmao. I hit #1 good. Definitely a miss on #2 though.

I'm more annoyed at the Labour MPs that didn't vote for it - I expect more from them
5’8ish my guess. The one thing that blew me away I went to a COD event was how short majority of pro’s are
It's so really sad how praising the Creator ([NAME]) has become something associated with terrorism... Astaghfirullah.
Turgeon offense at it's finest. The ball never gets past the three point line and [NAME] just hits a three in someone's face.
well that's no creepy in the slightest
Ahem. There are those who think that life Has nothing left to chance A host of holy horrors To direct our aimless dance
>the silent majority This is the most ignorant thing I've read so far today
I can when enough time has passed. I've got each of their playoff games from that year and it's fun to relive it during the offseason.
I got an unsolicited text from wal-mart earlier today and I almost went into orbit. Spam texts are completely unacceptable.
Putting them away feels so good it’s worth the frustration. Snipers dropped my career KD by like .15 >__<
Anyone else see her 10 year challenge post today or yesterday. I'm so shocked she wouldn't pick this picture.
She was walking like that shoe was up her butt at the club. So tacky and just nah.
Putting your finger and a loose cloth inside the 3 jaw chuck to polish the inside is insanely dangerous
That's pretty much what you signed up for when you had kids.
The BMW had to pee really bad.
The only one to really be sad about losing is [NAME] tbh
That one guy barley touched the car and it stoped
There’s nothing more oppressive than having all the power in the world and then having a minority group point it out to you
"Wow, amazing job, Mr. [NAME]! Another liberal absolutely DESTROYED with facts and logic! So eloquent and wise..."
There's no in between. Your example is the only other way they could have handled it.
I don't think that's true. Every major story I remember from the [NAME] investigation has been from court documents.
Dang. Wash that thing out with some soap.
It’s something put aside in case I really screw up and have no other option but return home
It was a joke long before the meme haha
"[NAME] & [NAME]? Also, his ass is as big as her back. "

"Watch your back u/Youareapooptard, [NAME] might hunt you down and burn you alive for that relatively minor insult"
I cringe at every part of all of this
"Honestly, this has got to be the most reckless way to bully and harass a kid. Kids have a tendency to grow to their expectations"
The bourgeoisie elected courts were going to backtrack on all [NAME] economic reforms. Fuck those guys.

This meme describes how I feel about 2018 pretty accurately. Cheers to a golden 2019!
I was rooting for the saints. There’s no way in hell the rams will beat the patriots

It'd be a real shame if someone killed it and stole its soul.
"I can hear [NAME] now: ""Why don't I have a mic why don't I have a mic FUCK I need a mic"""
I was killed by him I didn’t actually run. By the time he got back he wasn’t there

Exactly why I’m saying we won’t land KD ... but Knicks fans do know a lot about dreaming.
We could cure child cancer and pictures like this would still make me happier
The “figuring it out” part seems really hard
I think it was a one time thing because they still go for a lot more. I got lucky.

"Manipulation. I love my mother btw, but this thing is insidious."
Pull your fucking pants up oh my god

I don't have children yet so I will just have a long conversation with my balls tonight
Inheriting your dad's company when he dies doesn't count you spoilt piece of shit.
Being born in north america is a curse my friend. Oregon (my home) is kind of like Ireland weather wise though I hear.
"Oh sorry- to be clearer, I meant everyone not on the APP looking for a scooter will get sick of seeing random scooters. "
I was in that phase for a good while until i lost it all later anyways.
"I'm in a similar boat, had surgery to correct Pectus Excavatum when in 2011, also 18 now, also deal with constant chronic pain."
I gave the show a chance because I enjoyed Bad Education. AP Bio is pretty bad compared to it. Hopefully season 2 improves.
The general rule is that [NAME] is talking rubbish whenever he opens his mouth.

Saw this a couple days ago and had to stop it and rewind!
Yes! Wonder how tall the girls will end up 😂
Its to bad he doesn’t give Tomlin this treatment.
All those things are definitely your fault. She is much better off without you.
"From what im seeing. ""The democrats can stop this if they just let him build the wall. Its their fault."""
"For religious folks, good and beneficial stuff that happens is always sent by [NAME]. Bad stuff... The [NAME] works in mysterious ways."
"I don’t like [NAME] all that much, but that dude seems cool. I hope it hits a goofy dark line like [NAME] or [NAME] tho."
Another rich person to hired for him to be killed.
Sure. The subject of her video was certainly creepy and obnoxious.
"Happened right in front of our condo. Saw them cover the body after trying to revive him. It's been 6 months, not a year."
"Sorry, no punch line today. You guessed correctly on half an apple tho. Cheers"
"Virtually no happiness anymore, exhausted with trying, meds not working properly and just tired of it all."
Ahh going to bother me I remember it. Let me do some research!!
"Extol is the band that introduced me to progressive metal in the first place, still my favorite genre."
"I've had such bad memories, I remember when I remember bad times now! Haha"
Sorry for your loss. Thoughts and prayers.
Imagining ten generations alive at the same time *is* a terrifying concept.
I liked the Celtics until I started following barstool.
This hurts me more than the fan meme.
My biggest fear is catching feelings. I got dangerously close once lol. It’s just about self control.
"He also probably hasn't finished school but has seen like, all the [NAME] lectures so he totally already know everything."
No we're getting Kinsler and be happy with it
"Me, too. Was shocked to say the least."
I've been watching too much my 600lb life...I instantly hear dr. [NAME]
I love being down by 10+ constantly.... I feel like [NAME] gets dominated by literally everyone.
"Flat out getting our ass kicked. Gotta give it to Memphis, they have just shut us down"
I’m wondering about those friends of hers that encouraged her to contact you..
Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.
He posted about white racists on a post that has nothing to do about racism. Pretty sure he is just racist.
"It was worth mentioning anyways, the Packers are a special kind of awful."
"The beauty of that is you won't need alcohol or drugs, you'll get a cute buzz going from the measles fever."
The best music for the best voice....epic & timeless 🎶❣️
You are unfortunately far and few between.
This shirt IS a problem. Get rid of it.
"That sounds awful )-: I'm so grateful that my parents and therapist want to let me figure this out with minimal ""supervision"""
Because idiots in this sub care too much about what other people have on their screen? It only tells me that too many people on here are narcissists.
Omg didn't even think of that! So clever! Yes!
they dont have to buy all of it.
"My mums told me about gunmen standing at the end of her driveway escorting her family to school, really shudder worthy stuff"
"1 5v5 goal in 2 months is not good anyway you spin it. But pleasure being downvoted by you, enjoy believing in WAR "
For a second I didn’t see the t in “stack.” Was wondering how you did that but nvm.
People really spend more than $10 in an app game? I mean an actual video game I can understand but that's just...sad
"(While I love this moment, she wasn’t a judge, she was an inspirational guest.)"
I refuse to watch this. Lifetime exploiting [NAME] gross behavior to sell 'entertainment'.
Not defending [NAME] at all but this is just super sad if it’s true...
"If that's what you call ugly, I'm basically a hangover vomit that someone stepped on lmao."
"Sorry, but [NAME] doesn’t even compare to [NAME]."
Sadly this is not a new issue for Ukraine. Please take a moment to remember Babi Yar :(
I hate when these crooks say it ain't so cuz it is🇫🇷😤

"My god it is, dont forget the 2.50 innocent smoothies too"
Our 2nd unit is as bad as anybody in the NBA
WHAT you guys get this show on Netflix? We certainly do not get it in Canada what is this bullshit
We thought he was getting better but then he turned himself around.
"Ah man, I’ve downvoted it now. OP you suck"
I got bit by a Pomeranian while doing a dash...
"If you have this many concerns and red flags going, or something seems off, you can back out whenever you want, do it now. "
Hm... I can't help you then. I always go cold-turkey from any addiction I decide to quit. :/ That doesn't work for everybody.
"It's a really bad attempt to get attention and make people mad, that everyone in this thread has decided to indulge."
"Yup, I rather take those small shots get messed up than drinking a diarrhea drink. "
Any good reading on [NAME]? I don't really know if I like her or not.
"Believe it or not, but I saw that he's a college instructor now"
What? You don't know what punishment is?
Have thought most of the game was OK with some bad calls both ways... These last 5 min tho...
I'm afraid that will leave Britain no better. Can't imagine the ruckus if remain wins.
2.5%? That not so great for [NAME].
Although every moment you suffer will last more too...
im shaking and crying right now this is so powerful
Awesome! Congratulations. That is a nice investment.
About as odd as it is noticing a hockey players finger nails on tv
Same! I don’t know how our elementary level colleagues do it. When I subbed in elementary a few times it was awful.
"It's the ""boyfriend around school haha jk"" thing that makes it weird."
It's more like the western world is infuriated that a non-democratic Asian republic is on the trajectory to becoming the leading superpower. Case in point ^
Youre not a prude. Trash does what trash does.
My son isn't old enough to remember his brother and my husband and I feel like that's a blessing.
Don’t I know it! I can’t believe this breading station thing is so enormous.
And then you got a little vacation from work too! :D
Damn I didn't realize we just locked up the season series against the jets. That's good to see.
"I knew you had kids, i didnt know they were old enough join the military lol. Well happy bday to your son, dad. "
"On time stat doesn't matter for anything meaningful, I wouldn't waste time contacting support over it, or worrying about it for any reason really."
"I hope you're ok, I feel this post :( big hugs from me"
This is going to end badly for him
I hate roundabouts. For some reason road designers have a fetish for them as more and more are popping up. For cyclist they are rings of death
"Honestly, I wouldn’t want to poop without my phone either. Gotta scroll reddit while I’m poopin!"

"“Jinkies, unmasking the monster is such a pain... Nyeeeeeeeeh~.”"
"Emotes have a ridiculous amount of effort put into them, which only makes the fact that nobody uses them sadder"
Anyone that actually takes the train daily can tell you that. And I do feel its getting worse.
"No, he was hecka hungry and coming down to McDonald’s would mean being caught."
Just my opinion friend. I don’t know why it offends you so much.
"Good lord, totally missed that. What a croc."
Me cheering for the Wild this year
"As bad as this sub was in the 1st quarter, our announcers were just as awful."
He was in the merge lane and should have yielded. He was legally in the wrong.
"Cause his value is at the lowest now.. If he does improve and score goals for Monaco, he'll be sold in the summer. "
I like [NAME] but he's biased. If he's planning to becoming a real journalist he needs to leave his bias at home.
I play teemo support and nobody can stop me.
Could you make a ten hour version? I’m tired of having to replay this so often
"Her expression kills me. *WAKE ME UP, WAKE ME UP INSIDE* "
"It wasn’t, [NAME] threw it out first, I just thought the no charisma was the better burn."
"Either way, I am afraid his marriage is over. She doesn't respect him anymore..."
"Thank you mods for the sticky. This is such an important story. To my surprise, the NY Times had a brief piece about it."
"Not only do they make me cringe, I become angry because usually or is my nmother and her flying monkey daughter posting them. Just horrible."
It's not uncommon for OTPs to not use their mics or stay out of chat all together because of all the flame they get.
"Crazy how you could interchange ""husband"" with ""child"" and it would work the same. Ugh. "
Mom-emotions are always heartwarming and honest but dad-emotions make me tear up. Fuck
"No, but we have beer and whiskey "
I think the biggest fucking thing is that apparently reaper has a goddamn family himself.
Are your boys really doing the hand clap meme? Holy crap is this cringey.
It's funny when a whole sub rejects any new information which doesn't fit their narrative.
And that smilie she gave the fiancé when he sat down with the sandwich....I would be scared if I was him.
Good to hear that! I’ve seen many ppl trashing [NAME] customer service so I was kinda worried
No point in getting rid of Keemun for another Keemun.
I have no interest in yes men/women in my life. You obviously just want people to run around kissing your butt. Good luck with that.
At SkyZone with the kid getting some energy out. Next up is a dentist visit...ugh
I gotta try that with my posse next time I’m on. That’s hilarious
0% But then again most of us on here aren't placing top 8 at majors so that could factor in

"Yes, which is why I hate the term ""ranked choice voting""."
Holy shit was that the one guy that supported remain? I didn't know we had a celebrity on this board.
the fuck? I would do it in a heart beat. ya'll nuts if you think [NAME] will draft any better than [NAME]
Mine once went 6 hours overdue. It was horrible. Big hugs to you. Drink all the wine you can find!
My boss had this conversation with me just before Christmas. I start my new job in February.
You're an idiot and no one believes you and your telegram jerk-off buddies.
They don't seem to care much. Al qaida or ahrar al sham makes little difference anyway.
Ya done goofed kid. All you had to do was win.
So now disabled people don’t have rights . You get worse .
Far more to do with being entirely irresponsible and dumb than anything related to benefits or tax claims.
Surprised he's in. Imagined he was concussed. He was on another planet for a bit.
Am I the only one waiting for [NAME] turn from ‘politics’ to porn?
I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story.
Considering it’s a much deserved promotion I can’t be mad in the slightest.
Ha ha ha. That was a good one
"Nope, you're right, it's the same tweet you're thinking of, check the date. "
"As a woman, I have to say I think you aren’t wrong about this."
"Huh, I'd missed this one when looking for new games a few months back. Might have to give it a try."
Gotta wonder how a fake BC could possibly result from a 'mixup'.
Ded game we should be happy we have a new hero
As much as I don’t like his splits would have liked him on that contract that’s a huge miss for the dodgers imo.
"OMG If you like weed with dust, hairs, & whatnots..."
[NAME] pretty famous for that. I love the show but there is an entire episode that is blatant anti-nuclear energy fear mongering.
I used to enjoy it and grew out of it.
"yeah, they both suck... i am not a customer of either, and never will be again."
I think that had to do more with not wanting to hurt the old man lol
"If my team lost like that, I’d definitely be very upset. Just hard to see it."
"I go to a neighborhood mexican restaurant monthly for the past 2.5 years, but nobody knows my name ☹"
Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action
He mustn't know about Mr. [NAME] and the cause of his untimely death.
That's so amazing! I am happy for you both!
sorry. I don't want to put words in your mouth.
"Yeah, not having a system that treats a kid that can't read as an emergency is a problem. "
I had a similar fear last month after exceeding the two hours in a Homebase car park.
"Can confirm as my first time commuting by motorcycle in the rain there was hail, then lots of thunder bolts and lightning , found it very very frightening. "
"I haven't watched the original FMA, but you're definitely in for a fun ride with Brotherhood. Hope you enjoy it!"
"Because at best, you’re a racist and an apologist for at least a wanna-be dictator and his supporters "
"I can only download games using SteamCMD at work at the moment, so yeah, glad I could buy it before the shutdown"
"I already have used one, really helped "
No! Mom said it was MY turn!!!!
I cringed so hard my vagina fell out.
This communities inability to understand sarcasm is absolutely awe inspiring.
Skiing is great but I haven’t been skiing yet this season rip
"I've have a serious fear of getting winded, this video made my balls fall off "
Yeah but being president is the only thing keeping him from being indicted so he’s kinda stuck.
>a Thursday night rampage that killed the 22-year-old officer and shot up a surrounding downtown neighborhood. Not exactly a constitutional standoff with the government
I just actually listed it for trade haha. I can’t use paypal unfortunately as I’m under 18
Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me.
I'm so happy this whole group of lines was poster. It made my day...
"Hey, you can make baseless claims if you want. Don’t expect people to just believe you though."
I can only enjoy memes if they have been AI-checked to have never been uploaded to vine or tiktok. Otherwise I can not find it funny.
Omg that’s a perfect idea! I obviously want to avoid the stalker thing but I do love basketball and understand it so this seems possible
"This... This is where my journey ends. I was not able to make it to the end, good luck future redditors! "
My husband never watches this show. Watching with me: “[NAME] is a horrible dad. He looks likes he hammered. He’s so greasy”
Well one of them is a dirty kimono wearing weirdo
Imagine my shock... but he does seem very representative of the left.
He is just awful enough to do something like that.
Glad to see that [NAME] no more is a fellow r/Atheist user and anti-Peterson
"Those people are seeking fame and riches, of course they're gonna run into scumbag predators"
Crazy how before the offseason everyone was talking 350-400 mill deals for [NAME] and [NAME] as if that was all but inevitable

"I think it's normal. Don't analyse how you look like and worry about it btw, those idiots sure don't when they say their bullshit"
"TTs have size limits. The group I was acquainted with had, ahem, ""leadership"" problems as well."

"One time, she punched me in the face. It was AWESOME."
Isn't North Dakota more important? Or are they just the sacrificial canary in the coal mine?
I get migraines too and I’m sooo tired the first two days of my period
Right. I’m surprised everyone thinks he’s so cute...
It's even worse when you get someone from NJ who has no clue how to drive in the city environment.
[NAME] will probably get something as worse as [NAME] in ep4
>Playing competitive MTG has brought me as much joy as my children. Yeah this conversation is over
I'm so sorry that [NAME] has convinced you that his insane aggression isn't important.
it depends who i would murder and blame
Ha me too. I’m afraid we’ve been called out
[NAME] looks like she is satisfied with the lesson she taught her son
Every Saturday for the foreseeable future will be spent studying for the LSAT. Fuck
"My best friend waited 5+ years for her boyfriend in prison to come out. Two days before coming out, he dumped her."
I have a religious friend who i agreed with early on that we could make fun of each other's beliefs/lack of. We're still best friends :)
[NAME] i really hate entitled people. Upvote if you think that EPs are worse than Antivaxxers.
"Whoa, settle down big texter!!!! Not even sure how that happened?"

Actually there are some terminals now that let you disable it lmao. Very sad.
"Help, I'm scared and want to go back."
It's amazing how polar opposite [NAME] is from Thibs
And the players who are older than me are retiring and it looks like I might never play professional baseball.
I went to college to get an MRS and all I got was this lousy BS!
Omg. This is the real gem in this post. Thank you sir
"I do. Am chemist. Stop serving me things that remind me of work, goddamit."
"This was a floating barge of bullshit bound to ignorance, which is headed for a recycle bin on my desktop."
Sadly I think this is true & maybe this is the incentive adults need to get into action
Damn. This has to be one of the wrongest predictions ever in this war.
There is a special place in hell for drivers like you. I pray to [NAME] there is.
he defended [NAME] when [NAME] drugged and butt raped a 13 year old girl
No kidding. Pretty sure my husband enjoys it as much as I do.

I adore this. It gave me so many chills of happiness!

I'm not ready for that so I won't believe it
"I was won against an ultra-hard brexiteer, he tried to hit me with an uppercut but I just teleported behind him."
It's not vague at all. No one aside from slave owners thinks anyone has a rightful claim to another persons life.
I've always wondered how cases where an individual gets a 7 or 8 figure sum issued against them work in practice
A year is way too short. You won’t know the impact of Brexit till 2030 really.
Omg l live for [NAME] stirring the pot!!
[NAME] is going to be jealous of this photo
I thought I could handle it but I was wrong. Good [NAME] was I wrong.

Hahha i agree but i still want him to say sorry.
"This is why, when I do it, I'm gonna do it as quick and brutally as possible. This is inhumane."
Dude I have a verrrrry strong feeling the barber did that on purpose. Nowhere in the world is that an acceptable haircut. That’s fucked up

Maybe you just enjoy the process of digging? Does it have to be somebody you’re attracted to or have you tried stalking a random person?
:o thats pretty good. Not what envision my boy [NAME] but I like this alot.
"Well, I don't agree, but I do appreciate having a real discussion rather than just name calling lol. Agree to disagree"
With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn’t be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
I was expecting this to go MUCH worse than it did and I’m so glad my imagination wasn’t right.
They gave me free Subnautica which is an incredibly wonderful game so I'm pretty darn happy. And it's not exclusive.
Vegas favorite getting No picks. That's gotta be pretty unusual

Wow what's it like to be so petty? (Fixed)
"Since we've already established that we're talking about the present at this point and not the future, you can just pity the current generation of kids."
He does look old. Could just be a poor rendering because [NAME] doesn't look so good either.
They are loving this choice in maga canada of course. Just a typical day of bigotry.
"Intended as a ""it's funny because it's true"" not ""this is hilarious"""

Those words you used. I don't want to believe that exists.
"Yeah, even good people can become radicalized by religion "
Any food shortages will be caused by these idiots each buying 38 tins of beans a few days before we leave.
I enjoy shouting this at my husband and our friends when they're being especially nerdy.
It's ridiculous that [NAME] has inspired way more people to join rather than leave but there are way more media articles by people who have left.
"Doesn't matter if hes in this sub, hes sliding into your girl's DMs rn!"

I'm so sorry you were bullied in a place you should have felt safe.
I hate when I get extremely bored doing something that was once all consuming.
"thank you for taking the time to answer, im freaking out big time"
That guy is being intentionally obtuse. Down vote trolls are a waste of everyone's time.
At least it made for hilarious responses by people being aghast by the price.

Nirvana is a great band but a good chunk of people in their fan base are just awful (underratedly awful)
I can't keep up! This drama is too much 😭🤣
Have thought most of the game was OK with some bad calls both ways... These last 5 min tho...
I'm not on it I was just wondering for the sake of knowing.
"Sorry man, you’re a great person and all. But margarine??? Downvoted*"
We all know that everyone was doing the Kiki do you love me ironically so that if people do it unironically then we can make fun of them.
[NAME] what a piece of shit! How could you do that to an animal?!
Besides this and diablo immortal what else did this recently? I feel like there was one more big one but I cant remember what it was.
That whole episode has some heartbreaking moments. It is probably my top Parks And Rec episode.
"Yeah, without the music that scene would have been much worse."
"Lucky it wasnt a prosthetic leg, those abnormal body parts are how they get you"
[NAME] doesn't do nihilism. She's war ravaged. Ergo she has to recover.
"Do people really use the phrase ""my kid is poorly"" to mean sick? The grammar in this post is really bothering me."
After hearing weights drop - I can't imagine they're that good for the floor....
"I'm sorry to hear, come see me when you die."
FWIW I had a terrible series of experiences at CFA and would never recommend anyone with anxiety go there.

More like lovely shiny apples and rotten oranges covered with mold.

"as a kpop stan and a army, i am very disappointed"
"The fact their team is stacked makes me hate them, along with [NAME] being a dirty player. Also they are in our division "
It's disturbing that you even have to ask that.
I'm sorry that happened to you. You planned a awesome day that I wouldve loved celebrating with you. Happy Birthday
2017's sky high fees proved that this tech fails on a large scale. It's a disappointing reality.
You did so good for yourself though! If you had the mother you deserve she would have the sense to be proud of you. :)
Her husband is disgusting. I can’t even look at the cute baby when his face is in the shot.
"Love [NAME], but he is really dumb when it comes to politics and economics."
I will take it a as serious question. Sorry. I am in Europe

Noooo I missed the blood moon again. Someone post a pic
I had a total of 5 pet chickens. No way I could've ever eaten any of them. Glad that gfather confirmed that Banana Chip was buried.
I shout at my kid from the sidelines to stop fucking about with the draw-sting on his shorts...think I've got a shot?
None of the movies deserve it and honestly the oscars are a sham at this point.
What? I don’t just want to sleep with him. I want more idk... I value myself
It feels oddly comforting and familiar that we suck at hockey again.
What a beautiful sight that was to behold. Glad I was able to attend a couple of great [NAME] performances. “K” signs everyone

How do they know how tall you are while your sitting in your car. Such bullshit.
I know North America is a big place but I wonder what it will take to see similar crowds in cities over here.
He is too quiet in games too often. Not to good at mid and deep catches
"You know this is really messed up and unacceptable, but it mainly forced the realization that I’ve never played with Omniknight."
Is it that good ? i'd need it too in that case :(
This happens to me a lot. I'll also sing the same phrase over and over.

"I’m sorry, I don’t hear the excuses for harden post season success after he blew two 17 point leads in G6/7. "
I don’t think [NAME] knocking us out of the copa would change anything. Our team is incredibly lethargic.
Animal Crossing made my wife into a vicious and abusive murderer.
I am vuri disappointed in you. You gained turdy pounds tis munt. Scale dont lie
You got this! Go easy on yourself man..
[NAME] pays big. He bought out Hot Doug’s so he could enjoy their foie gras sausages 4x a day.

"“[NAME], I tried to make ramen in the coffee pot and I broke everything” - [NAME]"
SC is still the only game that makes mt entire body overheat to the point of death.
I cringe when I see [NAME] playing while we’re stuck with sensitive old [NAME].
"yup today hit me extra hard since im unemployed. i feel like im not meant to work, or meant to do anything really!"
This sounds like the kind of comment my weird uncle would leave on my Facebook post.
It’s very difficult for men to have platonic friendships with women. Unfortunately it’s just part of life.
Oh my gosh. This woman who died also had a son who died. Holy tragedy
"I'm not covering for anybody, trump included."
She hasn't even fully moved out yet and I feel the same way. I'm sorry. I know how awful it feels.
There is a startling lack of empathy in this thread.
I always wondered how testicles sound when popping.... hoping that it would never happen to me.
I'm sorry. I wish I could give you more hopeful answers.
"Burnout takedown. Then when trying to recover in the weekend, a nice chunk of self condemnation."
That must have bean awesome to find those
I'm surprised that the police have not send her to a mental institution
"Paraphrasing [NAME], this brought warm feelings to my heart."
Didn't u just say ur new to this? Why are you speaking?
"Yeah, but the thing is that I did send them. Therefore, I don’t have them, and haven’t for months."
$20k - $30k is not an unrealistic sum. It would cost that much and more just to sell or house.
Your comment is completely irrelevant and you're trolling me in order for you to cry and whine about Detroit. Get out of here.
"I don't think WI is lean red, after 2018 I'd argue for it being either tossup or lean blue."
"Aw man I thought you liked ""Forgoing the Playoffs"""
Was it just me or when they showed the backboard camera did the hoop look like it had a surprised face?
I can do that too but I have diarrhea

"You hang your head in shame. Not because of this, but just in general."
"im not talking about a studio. im talking about *people*. people that you're lying about, because you're an uninformed yet arrogant, entitled child."
The difference between the two to the right is quite massive.
"Nah, they're a fraction as immature and petulant as the politician we can't ignore that actually affects our lives."
"She later drunkenly slipped on her puddle, fell onto the tracks, and was run over. RIP"
It's not like anyone else is ever a jerk on twitter of course.
Nothing seems to intrigue or satisfy me only drugs and thats sad.
Interesting. Never heard of it. Do you like it?
That's not irony. Just coincidence. (I know this is [NAME] tweet).
If all else was equal it’d be a good idea but I don’t think it’s feasible.
Nah man. This website smells like toast and makes my left arm hurt.
I'm unsure how much more I should invest in this train of thought.
I’ve massively improved but it never really gets cured. There are always situations that will give you anxiety.
Well good for you man. Enjoy :)
Honestly I don't care if they're faked. It's an original concept that I find pretty funny
"Man, I would cry tears of joy if my two-year-old cousin could just say my name, let alone say a coherent sentence."
She reminds me if [NAME]. Half haked pictures with vague sayings. Ugh
I didn't see it either! I feel like the kid at the birthday party that didn't get a piece of cake...

"the original concern was about one particular type of vaccine, not all vaccinations."
Surprised he didn’t get hit with a random drug test
How the fuck do you moan tho
Happy Daily Peko #270! Source couldn’t be found I think it’s from the manga.
And those poor kids are still paying for it. And we have actual grown adults that are bullying them even today.
>This weird exploding ice [NAME] I haven't seen before? Wow. I... that's some ick right there.
"No, I'm saying they are equally critical."
It's satirical but also almost truth. We're the fattest nation in Western Europe and that percentage is growing.
Omg I’d happily live in Cape Town instead of the US!! It’s literally one of my favorite cities on earth!!
They likely just didn’t have enough forex to pay their bill 😂
Someone who will probably harass you for not having as much money as him.
Love everything about this city except it’s MLB team
"Really visually haunting though. For me, it makes me think of strange alternate futures and dystopian sci-fi worlds. "
Your link won't load and are you seriously citing fucking Syria as a successful example of anything? [NAME] holy motherfucking pecker.
Oh true I remember seeing it on Spotify’s charts for weeks. It’s terrible.
"If it was low-fat mayonnaise, their response may have been justified. That stuff is horrendous."
I have failed you [NAME]. I have failed you.
Nah it's just weird that they wouldn't try diazepam first since it's so often used.
Please boycott them! I'd love some shorter queues.
An accurate but depressing assessment of our political system.
Im 13 I can't get a job..
What a nasty goal! Gives you chills!
That's really creepy. What is crazy is that 9 year old's get cell phones now! Times have certainly changed :p.
Your wife's behavior is inconsistent with continuing your marriage to her.
Recent Russian behavior is unacceptable...no doubt about it.
He seems like the most genuine dude. I’m so happy to have him as our coach.
"with a locker room like this is looking to be, I don't think Ohio State is done losing games that they shouldn't"
I wasn't sure either. I'm 30 and my doctor has never said anything about getting retested or revaccinated.
I heard Netflix was cutting a bunch of content so I'm going to cancel and drop all the content myself! 4d chess move baby!
I hate it when mom and dad fight.
Ah. Ok. I get it. Have an upvote.
"The last time it happened I just said, ""No"" and closed the door"
"I can’t work, wish I could. Worked hard my whole life and lost literally everything a few years ago. 20 years down the drain."
Mother of [NAME]... Im not grossed out very easily. I can stomach just about anything. But this made my fucking skin crawl....
Very true. Apologies if it came off that way.
"Considering the whining he did in our modmail, he may not realize this."
At least this makes me feel better about not being photogenic. It’s the cameras fault!
Another racist foul by the Raptors on [NAME]
I think that would be stretching the usual usage of whataboutism. Obviously I am not the arbiter of what it means as a new word.
"I like taking 450 every 2-3 hours. Not the best hangover, but lots of CEVs and I enjoy the OBEs, floating thru the dark. "
Looks like you got it bad. How soon till you can get out on your own?
WON ME 1K LAST GAME IN PARLAY!!
"Dating [NAME] tends to wear you down, late 20s must’ve been rough"
What the hell did you just type?
[NAME] is often regarded as strategically the worst Lord in the series because of this. [NAME]
"Sorry mate, you’ve got the wrong sub. This is for **bad** UK."
Because it would look worse than 2D art.
This is the scariest thing I think I’ve ever read on here. That is just so horrible.
Poor kid. He just wanted to rescue his mum from a nefarious organisation. I hope he gets decent representation.
"Oh sorry. To clarify, I was wondering if I should mention that I am more than willing to help her if need be."
I'm worried that even in the summer we're not going to have the funds necessary to do that.
"Finally, I can sit on another person’s lap and have them not be disgusted"
"Bro, this is not what this sub is for."
"No, I definitely understand that feel and empathize. That can be hard to deal with. How have you been as of late?"
She's out on the town getting banged like a screen door in a storm. You might as well have the talk.
[NAME] ignored [NAME] and I loved it
I'm not saying its in a good position im just saying just cause a guy enters free agency doesn't me they will only get scraps from teams.
Can't speak for the original commenter but probably not yours since I'd rather not be tortured for eternity for disbelief.
"My only criticism is xhaka, too slow on and off the ball."
ESPN and sports is not a good combination.
Probably left the crusts on ! Borderline abuse right there !
fat people want to be oppressed so badly. I guess it's because they need an excuse to emotionally eat.
Stargazing with Vi is definitely my favorite moment of the season so far
Because he's attractive. Hence [NAME] come out in droves to defend him despite the fact he's a horrid asshole.
Just a joke post on how someone will go through blah blah blah and come out on top.
This hurts me more than the fan meme.
"No, [NAME] has said more than once it was not. "
I've seen [NAME] at the bars in Huntington a couple times and every time I see her I buy her a drink.
Omg.........so true. I found that out personally. She was flirting with other guy's online @ 3 in the mornings. Wtf😟☹🤣
"Is this in the US? 30k per year blows my mind, my tuition is like 9k ish a year+rent"
i just don’t think we are aggressive 100% of the time
Damn how I wish [NAME] was there just to see his reactions to [NAME] questions 😂😂
">the decades after WWII That includes 1950. If you want to insult me, read your own fucking post first"
"Have you read the AUMF? It's insane how much power it grants the government to prosecute the ""War on Terror"""
It's sad that we have to think of it as a miracle and not a regular occurrence :/
The only advice I'll give is to not come back here when you find out that she's cheating on you.
The new stylish stadiums will look outdated in 15+ years. Standard stadiums will still look the same
No where was I blaming [NAME] for the lose but he didn’t help. I just dislike his game.
Thank you! In Germany and was sick of waiting and wondering
[NAME] receive the maximum sentence and her jail mates know that she kidnapped a child.
Thank you once again! I'm officially out of question now lol Happy New Year!
I can see the place where I grew up on here :)
You have no right to be there waiting to be nudged.
Super dumb that people are downvoting you for asking a question in good faith.
"And losing to division rivals gives them the tie breaker, no? Very frustrating. "
"As a person who lives in NYC, I couldn't possibly agree more"
Asking a baby to not be at your wedding isn't a jackass thing to do. It is *your* wedding
It's kind of worrying that you genuinely believe that left-wing people are actively trying to destroy their own country. Approaching USA levels of ridiculous viewpoints.
"Thats a red flag that you're a big part of his son's life after 5 months. This all seems very immature, both you and him."
"Bah gawd, she is broken in half!"
"I never heard ridiculous right-wingers mocking people for being ""triggered"" until ridiculous liberals started referring to themselves being ""triggered""."
Oh I missed that part. So the cheeky poster was referring to that crash. ;0
That is disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
"I doubt it, serial killers enjoy killing, the stuff they do afterwards is just the icing on the cake for them. "
My 3 year old is an asshole. His 8 year old sister was also an asshole at 3. It gets better!
I'll try that but I'm thinking about going outside when it is unbearable to sleep. Also I'm scared of cold making me more sleepy.
facetune is hard work you fucking pore. I work all day to support this family and this is the thanks I get?
"I’m sorry to inform you, it’s worse. "
"OMG, how did they do that? I mean killed Petunias. My pot is from Bunnings as well."
"Same, I'm really struggling to not become feminine because of that."
That cat's jump when the coyote takes his eyes off him.. Ouch!
Getting some sick high school nostalgia from this shot. Thanks for that man!
That's not what he meant. He means the use of a lot of different hashtags.
"As a painter in a body shop, this pains me to watch."
"Atheist here and I believe in freedom of religion, don’t let ppl get in ur head, believe in what makes you happy"
She immediately regretted it when you reacted like an excited 3rd grader

My Ping Pong Queen looks so happy! I cried lol
"Thanks, I find your poor implementation of punctuation to be very amusing. It's good that there's something we can enjoy about each other."
Monthly blood loss totaling 9-12 oz on average. That and never being able to feel safe.
"That's ironic. Because [NAME] isn't getting the Wall funded, we are pulling more resources off the border blockade effort?"
I'm actually surprised it stayed up. We already got a shitpost thread yesterday. I though the limit was one per week.
"As a lifelong single person, [NAME] offends me. Feels like I'm apart of some demographic that they can live without :("
"Safeco had these chocolate covered ""fruit kabobs"" that were damn good. "
what a surprise i never saw coming
"This is the sad truth for the exact reason he mentioned, they want a short fix to avoid doing this type of hard work."
You shouldn't force someone to come out you know. Now look at what you did! You killed [NAME]! You bastard!
My dad has an irrational fear of the dark.
Agreed. I'm happy he was able to find a resolution of sorts; to effectively overcome the event.
I believe it was clear I disagreed. And I don’t play wow.
Woah... I'm shortsighted and I can get 2 pairs of glasses for €149. $500 is insane!
It's so much worse with a child involved. I'm so sorry you have to go through this.

That’s not how roundabouts work. You give way to approaching traffic on your right. Doesn’t matter if they haven’t entered yet.
That sucks! Your lady giblets are NONE of her damn business. Does your BF at least try to curb her mouth?
haha! She is so creepy at times. What a great actress.
What you are describing is what I am feeling right now aswell. It's hard to handle the fact but atleast you aren't alone.
You are not a slave to your parents. You worship them by serving them. Otherwise you are a slave to [NAME].
#PLAY [NAME] I miss that :( baseball plz come back
You’re letting psychopathic people ruin your ability to take a joke. That is a mark of a weak man.
"Thought about that too, guess it's just not the games intention to make the player a part of the things happening in it..."
"but that’s exactly my point lol you get better at those things, the scary factor affecting skill learning becomes smaller and smaller"
"It's an unfortunate situation, but it had to be done at some point."
"That face screams ""Fucking gods, do I have to do *everything* around here?"""
I agree with you here but I don't see how he is a sexist?
How the hell do you get downvoted for a submission statement on /r/TrueReddit. Title or not it is still required.
"I can't believe you would call me that and act like nothing happened. Honestly, what's wrong with you"
At least you can admit you missed it
I've done that in the past. It means he's stupid drunk and is missing you at the moment.
Banning abortion causes way more harm than good and is evil to be against. Same with requiring suffering people to suffer. you seem evil
"When the caterer found out [NAME] was going to pay the bill out of his own pocket, perhaps they declined the honour."
"I have a 17 year old friend who just googles ""memes"" to get his fix"

"It's not exactly controversial that getting up early sucks balls, unless you're five and it's Christmas"

Whataboutism then. Some of the worst I've seen at that too.
I’m not crying... I’m just cutting onions... I-I’m making lasagna..
"I was there, too. I do NOT remember that, though. Yikes..."
"If ""everything is political"" then nothing is political because it's all the same. You know what I meant by ""political""."
This is so bad that I immediately retold it to everyone I know.
In Europe there's no way at all that the Democrats would be called left wing!
I have two and nothing has ever happened to me. The media doesn't want you to show your support because they want supporters to feel isolated.
"Yeah, that was terrible. [NAME] laughing and joking at the end of that game ended his career here."
Mine starts sweating and wondering why it’s so hot if the ac is on! 🤣😂
Damn you! Now all this dirty money is flooding Frankfurt and Dublin!
"Personally, I assume that those who claim NOT to be deprived in this way are just adept liars. That's how deprived I am."
The realization is pretty grim. Can't say I'm terribly happy.
That should be fun. I may have call in sick tomorrow. Lots of Bournemouth fans including my boss.
"I never heard ridiculous right-wingers mocking people for being ""triggered"" until ridiculous liberals started referring to themselves being ""triggered""."
"Is it just me, or do these children look really uncomfortable around the Duggars? The smiles look forced..."
I don't think you could actually find something that's *unambiguously* racist. That's just how dog whistles work.
The lesson is to not take 4 Ambien. That is just stupid.
Thats a meme? That feels more like depression
"I'm totally cool with that too, whats the PSN?"

The lack of stick skills [NAME] lacks is actually astounding.
It looks a little like my 5th grade science experiment...
"Oh you're getting trolls trolls. Damn what sub you think they are getting you from, lol I'm not gonna mess with them."

"I can't find year stats. Anyhow, I needed the Excel files or a list of numbers in a table."
This shirt IS a problem. Get rid of it.

"I'm interested, more than I should be."
Art degrees are useless! Now excuse me while I go watch a Pixar movie. /s
No! Mom said it was MY turn!!!!
Wow grats man. Hopefully I can use this inspiration for myself tomorrow. If there was something new you learned in this experience would share it?
"True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams."
"hmm... we don't need [NAME] now, we need ball retention"
I BELIEVE! I am sad that likely no one else will see it besides me...
"What’s weird is. I never miss anyone. Like, ever."
Yeah there's a lot of innately absurd conclusions this guy's drawing here
This thread is one of worst things I've ever read
His 2 point shooting has been bad this season atleast he is still staying aggressive
"It’s way too broken, anyone and their dog can use it."

It's murder and the kid can die I don't care but call it what it is and let parents know their kids whenever they want
"_Ooh, it looks like we just sold the last one earlier today_"
"I understand what he was trying to say, but [NAME] it came out badly."
good luck! i recently left the floor for an office job and couldn’t be happier.
Of course it bothers you. She just admitted that something inconsequential to your relationship would be a dealbreaker.
Oh boy... it must actually be kind of nice to be completely oblivious to how the people around you are feeling.
"Very happy to hear that. I hope he keeps at it, and is open and honest with them."
"Apathetic. Not happy, not sad, just don't care"

wow just shows how confused **I** was Ftfy Pretty fucking clear as day what was going on here lol I honestly don't know what to tell you
I'm...not going to let him see me cry.
Interesting I wasn't aware of this. Maybe proving the undue hardship is difficult but technically allowed? I wonder what counts.
My parents just couldn't understand that pick
-30??? Omg that's awful. Stay warm and sane
"[NAME] fucking [NAME] are you done yet racist motherfucker, you’re not helping society"
"Sadly, I don't even think its that the Chargers aren't prepared its that the Patriots are good at game prep."
A lot of people seem really ticked off at the idea of an honourary doctorate.
I don't think [NAME] gets enough hate for pushing that.
I wouldn't be surprised if the Cheetos dust was coming out of his sweat.
Captain you ARE wrong. You’re wrong nooption to argue. I have the final rule ! Nope not gonna listen.
"[NAME], I love these kinds of threads."
You're in for a treat- enjoy :)
Except [NAME] had his brains blown out by a .50 cal bullet at point blank range.
Also it seems like there is some possibility of the pole going backwards lol
My only issue is he keeps blowing draft picks on QB’s that are terrible.
Foot fetish people like pretty feet. Those are not.

America will lose. You are mentally-deranged and the enemy.
"The reaction is incredible. I’m quite certain it’s satire as well, but its impact is depressing as hell. "
Being too scared of calling someone isn’t a disability for fuck sakes... use some common sense and grow up.
Why is [NAME] still getting minutes? He is probably the worst player on this roster.
"You're already watching the world crash and burn, buddy. The progress toward human extinction is irreversible now. Your tormented heart can rest easy."
Stop it. You're giving me that warm fuzzies now.
Can’t tell if you’re joking. But it’s called a habit.
why are other dashers such [NAME] 🤣who made y’all so upset
"Instant fucking turn off, ugh. Fuck us for wanting equality across the spectrum"
"Oh, fuck off. It’s no one’s fault but yours that you think every mention of the word ‘men’ means you specifically. "
-30??? Omg that's awful. Stay warm and sane
"This is wild omg. Also, happy cake day twin!"
She was literally the worst manager I’ve ever worked for
And this young man wishes to be an athlete. That sort of strenuous activity would not be possible.
"Thanks :) I will still do the necklace, but probably just as a surprise gift."
She's slept with so many guys she's starting to look like one
"People talk so much shit when I say [NAME] is just a fast as [NAME] again, [NAME] just barely wins "
Obviously wasn't entitled to a functional brain.
In my opinion at night peds have just as much responsibility of being seen as drivers have to see.
[NAME] getting off beat the dribble is hurting me a little inside /: Edit:words
"If you'd like to suggest an alternative non-inflammatory metaphor for something that implies racism, I'm happy to consider it. "

"Thank you so much for this link, watching [NAME] was an absolute delight! "
I was there too! I remember it was a warm day during an otherwise cold time of year.
[NAME] does more than [NAME] so I'll have do disagree about that
Get in touch with a lawyer. No one in Reddit can answer this. Throwing her out really would be better.
"I mean, this very post is climate change denial related, which has zero to do with the second amendment, so I don't get your point "
Pepsi tastes better in the UK than Coke but US/Canada coke is pure diabetes and Pepsi is disgusting.
"Oops, accidentally fed the troll. Ah well, we all gotta eat. Guess I'm feeling charitable. 😉"
Kinda but it’s still a terrible meme
What a beautiful sight that was to behold. Glad I was able to attend a couple of great [NAME] performances. “K” signs everyone
It seems strange to me that [NAME] is still unsigned this close to the season.
"MeToo is about sharing personal stories of sexual assault. Reframing it as accusation based, and as furthering a kidnap, is fucking disgusting."
The comment came up as a text notification and old people are always convinced hackers are getting into their phones.
Nah... that's a slippery slope. Let's just take away their freedom and put them in a place where they can't have anymore kids

I want my Thick Blood feat to actually say “F*CK YOU” every time I deny a Peacekeeper their bleed damage.
Some people enjoy their music and their fans for the sake of others opinions.

At some angles you can get a ws4 into a combo but its inconsistent.
News just in from the incident last week. He's still in serious condition.
It's irrelevant because that's not how we elect presidents. He won an electoral landslide. He flipped several democrat strongholds. He did just fine.

Immigrant children dying in state camps? Horrible. Healthcare for the poor and eldery? Also horrible! Got it.

"Yikes. That’s straight up paranoid, you can tell they were looking through comments for someone to rage at. "

Really? Out of all Irish journalists? You had [NAME] and the two twat's off of Off the Ball up for grabs!
Most of the people on here don't really understand basketball. They are usually the people saying we should fire [NAME]

"Not really, in my mind it was continuous cringe that I was always curious about"
No I know they're on xbox. I just added that last part as a poor attempt to be funny.
It’s a smart move but also hurts the business and possibly false. It’s rude.
4-25 against teams with winning records. 0-7 on Monday Night Football. The guy can't show up when it matters.
"Life is nothing but a hell filled with torment, misery and loss."
This gets posted a lot. It’s not really that great. Interesting concept - the first hour had my interest - goes downhill the second half.
I really like the hot pot at Lucky Bamboo. Their dim sum made me sad.
I feel the exact same way. It makes me so insecure
> Love is more important than some job. You can't be serious? Please tell me you're just joking.
Merrily merrily merrily merrily something something scream... (I am not creative)
Fair enough. But he’d basically become an off tank with all that healing lol. I already get raped by reaper enough (tank main)
Well obviously not. Some people have higher tolerances than others. That’s a fact. I don’t know what else to tell you.
I can see why! I would totally be offended too!
Yaaaaaas! I need your curly hair routine!
I can’t believe he’s playing the live action sonic the hedgehog
Isn't Marquis literally a noble title and not his actual name. I don't think being nobility counts as a fair expectation for the modern youth.
Oh I wouldn't be surprised my dad got away with some shocking things despite cps investigation but he was also white.
He likes an old song and is young DISGUSTING
Facial hair ability: [NAME] Looks like [NAME] got a bloody nose a week ago and hasn’t washed the blood out yet.
i just don’t think we are aggressive 100% of the time
"But something is extremely wrong if people are getting sick. Might not be a sonic wave, but it definitely is *something*"
If it’s weed I’m going to be disappointed. Can’t we all just go to the store and get it?
I know how you feel and I’m sorry you’re going through that. But I’m glad you are still here
My least favorite couple: [NAME] and [NAME].
I’m pregnant and my dog is with my parents across the country while we renovate. The feels were too much 😭
Yeah I'm glad he got caught. What a piece of crap.well at least he won't be a virgin in jail anymore haha
Let's just see what [NAME] has to say about what really went down...
And I thought I was too old for this drama (I’m 25)
RIP. Sad for his family and the bull riding community.
I just don't like our options in the off season.
i do love how absolutely distraught the girls look
That basically means this site steals and sells your data so they don't want to make it GDPR compliant.
Wow. Have that much debit in your bovada account is something crazy. Props to you
He still has less health than [NAME] despite being slower and bigger and literally revolving around trading.
"I thought it may be the industry, but based on other people’s answers here, I’m not so sure :/ "
Or maybe he's just super hot? Can't help it if you're a casanova.
These stats don't specify if the cops are in the right for killing someone
The shading makes her face look like she has lumps under her skin.
"Maybe. You're running the risk of the trolley and kids being stuck on the carriage with the mum at the previous station. But hey, free groceries!"
Sadly the same way know people who know people and being in public. Maybe an online game with chat like league or xbox
No one does... that what makes it so provocative.
I love the way you phrased that. I do believe she is terribly afraid to look inward at herself.
Wow [NAME] has a lot more insecurities than I thought
LONDON I honestly don't even understand this one
Super Bowls are overrated anyways. s. I'm more angry about back-to-back seasons ending on a fade to Crabtree in the endzone.
r/rareinsults also i’m surprised this guy isn’t fussing over the “it’s” instead of “its”
Fair enough. But he’d basically become an off tank with all that healing lol. I already get raped by reaper enough (tank main)
"I’ve gone through it before, and it sucks. I’m still a little hazy and withdrawn."
I don't care what idiots think about me.
It's called a fullstop in England. My fucking immersion in this meme is ruined.
"Really!? I thought it had, or at least it should. Guess I'm better off leaving too"
I’ve thought about it... if my next job doesn’t really make me happy. My wife is all for it.
"When are you and dad going to pop out a few baby-mammas for us boys, huh? And that's the *less* disgusting alternative. Blech!"
That is not the typical sexual dynamic in western cultures. That's a crazy asshole.
How many gallons do we need is my favorite so far. The sad part is that it was always pleasant.
[NAME] has towed the line of the Dark Side. He wouldn't cross it by doing something like this.
OH MY GOD! The PTA has disbanded! Ahh! Ahh! AHHHHH •jumps through window•
Lol I lol'd *I too am down with the kids. But not like that because that would be illegal*
"I haven’t seen the episode yet but wow, what a reach."
"I like saying the n-word, it makes me happy"
[NAME] should be used to getting booed by Yankee fans though.
"I'd not help you either. Not giving that dude a 4k. Although, I'd be looking for hatch instead of nothing."
Keep yer grubby paws off our Dlo.
Oh you mean a documentary he produced? I watched it and it felt kinda bias imo
To me the toenails is the grossest part! 🤮
"I’m not attracted enough to her for me to ask her out, but I would have sex with if she wanted "
If it was Central Transport you might of got lucky. Sometimes I wonder if they even hve doors on the trailers things go missing an awful lot
"You're clearly upset tho, you're not doing a good job proving your lack of caring"
I’m sorry this happened to you. I’m glad you got out of it.
"I was going to put in the post that I wanted to smack her, but here in the comments I'll say, I wanted to smack her. "
And still our government is not responsible enough to pay its bills. It's rather pathetic.
"Here did you know that [NAME] slept with 35,000 women. Outrageous."
"Kind of wish they recorded a video of the shard of glass moving through the heart, we would all pee a little in our pants."
Let's kill and eat them all. That'll stop those damned animals from deforesting my forests
Trust me man. Don't see it. It's scarring.
I will call the police if you dont stop harassing me
It's not Russian land either. Your argument is still complete nonsense.
"Really? wow. I just reinstalled chrome from scratch, again. So it was Ghostery that caused the full screen issues?"
Glad to hear. It seems like a very hopeful sign. 👍
No. That is creepy and weird. If you don’t trust her .... move on.
"My boyfriend is so much like your husband. I’m so happy for you to have him, he sounds wonderful. "
"No. These are the people who loved someone with BPD, but got used/abused/abandoned by them. It's mostly romantic relationships. Family tends to be on r/raisedbyborderlines. "
Bishop [NAME] was talking about lawmakers rather than the women who seek abortions. Though the situation doesn't matter when it comes to dismembering a baby.
A sharp stick? I think you need a rifle to kill that bastard
Lmao I hope almost seems like it just vanished. If someone who likes xans finds my wallet they’re in for a good day
"Are you replying to something in particular, because what you stated is so obvious I would hope it need not be said on a science thread."
There’s no room for subtleties. This is a consensual nation.
I didn't say it would be impossible to assemble a computer. I said you wouldn't have one because they'd be too scarce and bloody expensive.
"I think they'd do ok (Sorry but as an INTJ a lack of my thoughts here is also bothering me, too)"
We're like bad luck lightning rods. Everybody around us is safe
WHAT. It says due date 12/31/18. Did she have the kid yet? Oh [NAME] I feel so bad for her and that child...... nooooooo
"Oh goody, another idiot trying to tell other people what we believe. You are trolling, end of fact."
Reading some of the stories on this sub make me appreciate my family more.
Nope. A mamzer is someone who was born from an adulterous affair between two [NAME]. You're 100% [NAME] though!
Omg I love that. Coffee in bed. A nice omelette and then another roll in the hay.
"Ah that's my school but I have yet to see this one, gotta keep swippin "
I'd rather die than drive a Volvo!
"Definitely the current worst, hence 20 actually buffs coming her way."
"[NAME]’ column the other day had an interesting line, “zealotry is often people working out their psychological wounds.”"
but if it weren't that way then a corrupt police force could convict many innocents. there is no correct answer to this problem.
IANL I have never thought twice about doing a little extra shoveling to help a neighbor. Can't imagine that it could be illegal.
I can’t tell who’s wooshing who but I’m afraid to ask by this point
Thank you.. Makes my heart happy that someone can appreciate this thread :)
"If it results in killing [NAME], [NAME] is willing to be merciful and hold his wrath back against the kids."
Glad you came to your senses. Go feel uncomfortable about Lola bunny in Space Jam again.
"It was inevitable, after so much cultural shading of men, that “toxic femininity” would enter the fray. Welcome."
I would see a doctor asap and get to a psychiatrist. Hallucinations of any kind are worrisome.
"For me, the only thing that makes it cringe is [NAME] covering his mouth"
It's a shame they have [NAME] because a Vuc package would be ideal
"That's awful. I'm glad [NAME] doing better, but he might have serious trust issues for life. "
This looks like don't hug me I'm scared
He knows he's not playing as well as he should be. By that logic [NAME] wants out so he should go too.
[NAME] is seriously in the top 5 best female characters ever written for TV.
"He's not a believer, so he doesn't see what he did as wrong. "
he defended [NAME] when [NAME] drugged and butt raped a 13 year old girl

We got heated toilet seats here in Japan. Big smiles.
"Wow, “Social” Democrats betraying the revolution. Who would had guessed?"
If you are at the stage where you want to quit then all you have to do is believe you can quit
I'm just an idiot on the internet. I don't know a doggam thing.
That was your saddest shortest story yet
"His! Watch out! That cars coming straight for you! Omg guys she’s arguing with ferrah, she can’t hear us help!"
"-40 on an obvious joke, [NAME] people."
"Thats a red flag that you're a big part of his son's life after 5 months. This all seems very immature, both you and him."
One more reason for us to have our own space program.
"I would never wish for someone to get injured, but an injury needs to happen at the Pro Bowl so they cancel it forever."
Is it bad that I’ve never listened to Sabaton?
Oh wow this is big. Thanks for the heads up. Indeed! So many great memories that I still like to reflect back on. Thanks!
"Whenever I'm having a bad day, I watch a few eps of Cosmos to chill out."
I love this show but I feel personally attacked when they say you can't live with 6 cups of tea a day and no food 😢
This article wasn’t much better. The errors begin in the sixth paragraph. Thanks for sharing though!
"I have, I've always wanted to celebrate Christmas and actually have a more closer family"
"That’s not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that’s a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply."
The main reason I left is a hidden mmr used to influence matchmaking in a mode that requires a paid entry. That's disgusting
Now that I've gone solar I'll never go back
Tear all of it down - that place is such a horrific example of trash civil engineering
"More like 11 feet up, but still painful. "
You told me it was pointless to point it out. You're the idiot
Amazing. And heartbreaking. I'm learning so much from little bits like that.
"I've been looking forward to this But damn, I was hoping for some epic revenge story ;-; "
People still expecting that are delusional regardless tbh. Messed up they'll never say what happened to Half Life but time to start using some context clues herr
It’s like she’s forcing a fake British accent it’s so strange
"And people try to hold that against [NAME] when they should hold that against the Packers organization and Front Office...Their Front Office stopped trying, not [NAME]."
Group hug to you and our fellow redditors :)

I might be having carrot cake tonight!!! I love it! And that coffee sounds like the perfect pair! Enjoy it
"It was indeed , but holy shit is that cheap and [NAME] :3"
Some do. Some don't. Blanket generalizations are almost always false and unhelpful.
"You know this is really messed up and unacceptable, but it mainly forced the realization that I’ve never played with Omniknight."
This is not a good formation. We’ve been over this. It just ends up being crossed lobbed into the box by [NAME]
I just have a controller on my desk that I turn on when I fly. I've always hated mouse flying.
"Nah, substance abuse is sad, period. "
That and customizable CSS makes me so happy. /r/Firefoxcss if you’re interested : )
Sorry. I am avoiding arguments today. Enjoy the video.
"Gnarly ballsack is the technical term, I believe. Sadly, it's just a face beard."
Sign my name to it too lol it was so awful we deserve pain and suffering for that!
What a REPOST! STOP REPOSTING THINGS PEOPLE LITERALLY JUST POSTED.
Lol you could have just said that
"Lost my kid to the system, wanna see wha the wee lassie has tae say"
Same here. My refund almost doubled from last year. I almost cried when I saw how much I'm getting back.
Thank you. I needed someone else to say it. The unnecessary misgender as a parting shot wasn't my favorite either.
Ugh... hate when people talk to me when I'm fishing. This would be so awful hahaha
What a crybaby. Don’t drink and drive.
"Your imaginary boyfriend is kinda creepy. Although, if he's kinky then he may be for keeps. *wink "
Sorry I am kind of new to posting here. Didn't even know that existed! Gonna try and move over there.
You are giving them human emotions. If you spent any time with cattle at all you would realize how silly that is.
Because you aren't serious. You're just mad because you got told to stop using slurs one too many times.
"For some reason I can't reply to [NAME], but also for the neysayers:"
I had no idea this was a thing!
"They were not really messing around, just more frustrated. They genuinely were trying to move specialists around to get the best out of people."
"Haha, no. But probably just because I hadn't thought to do it."
"What an awful video. I just wanted to see the jump in real time, not 10 cuts of the start, followed by 1 slomo finish."
So unsatisfying that it didn’t end with a pit maneuver.
I can't believe you're giving these trolls the time of day but good on ya bud. Epic post.
In the time I've been seeing this he has already lost 3
"Alright, so I googled aaaaaaand sorry for my misinformed mistake. Dunno where I heard that [NAME] didn't win the popular vote but it was wrong :("
"I was not expecting the giant ""POLICE STATION"" sign. That just makes it all the better. "
I can't believe he used the N-word.
The dryer sounds like a fire hazard to me.
"Not only does the overbooking hurt the customers financials and time, but violations like this one put lives in danger."
"Oh, doi. Makes total sense now. Boy I really hope I get fired for this blunder."
it's not but damn i'm sorry to hear how common this is
LOL at the tldr. What a crazy story. I'm glad the writer got some friendly new relatives out of it.
1 month feels like 200 years? School must suck
Yeah it's unexpected but I have to remove this because it's not satire or gatekeeping.
"Yay, just in time for the commute"
"Don't play dumb we all know what you were implying, you racist nazi. "
I hate that. PC is way better for using the internet. I also hate how all the important features for the website missing on phone version.
"I'll think about prime, just heard a lot of negative about them that spooks me some."
Glad you came to your senses. Go feel uncomfortable about Lola bunny in Space Jam again.
and of course if that happens then there's no way it could be true. as if a protester could also be a paedophile.........
Fear of awkward and inconvenient encounters. What can he do to you?
Neither are those 6 other pairs that I am wearing!!!
"Hope you don't touch the menus, they're the filthiest thing in any restaurant. "
What's even worse: the deciding voter refused to support the subway because he was strangely obsessed with a horse & buggy transit plan from 1858.
Some sort of f***ery is going on here.
"Thank you for not just writing some bullshit and actually being creative. Followed this sub for scary ideas but usually get cliche garbage. So Again, thanks"
"Pressure 7 targets/10 targets, popcorn, any tracking, and any tile frenzy because I enjoy trying to beat my highscore"
My only issue is he keeps blowing draft picks on QB’s that are terrible.
Otherwise it would be a terrible disservice to the NHL
[NAME] became president and yet you think [NAME] becoming president is farfetched? Lol
> While less than 1% of DV accusations end up being unsubstantiated I find that incredible.
Big yikes. Biiiig yikes. I do feel your pain. I wish I could upvote you more than once.
Super Bowls are overrated anyways. s. I'm more angry about back-to-back seasons ending on a fade to Crabtree in the endzone.
I think you overestimate the ability of politicians to rig the vote c.f. May 2017
Please explain “Hoover/ed”. Not familiar with the term. Thank you-
I never used an escalator until I was about 16 and I still remember moving stairs scaring the hell out of me
And I'm happy we all agree it's deathcore.
"Congrats! That could not have been an easy step to take, so I'm so happy it's been a positive experience."
"no, mostly just spurred from mild boredom and thinking of the [NAME] future. Getting a gauge at the caliber of players chosen at #12."
"Please stop posting things like this, this is serious, keep it civil, keep it real, thanks."
Literally everywhere. There's nothing especially Texan about any of this. I heard all of this in freaking SCONSIN.
I'm leaving to go get some more motherfucking jokes MOM [NAME]
My barber was thinning my Hair with a new blade and cut my ear. Bled like crazy.
"I got undifferentiated androgynous, just slightly more femme than masc, which, honestly, sounds about right as an AFAB nonbinary person tbh"
"Man fuck, I didn't come here for these feels..."
THAT FEELING WHEN YOU DISCOVER THE GOP CAN'T MEME
People would still always parry them (600ms) :(
"If you have schools in your city, I got bad news for ya champ..."
If you would do exactly as that kid did - then you will never get it. You’re defending a smug little asshole.
Astonishing. I've read about these people but have never met one. I am so relieved for you that she is out of your life.
It was on a washed out road in the at 2am. Which makes it even worse. They never should have been towing that vic.
Omg! An attentive parent actually teaching their children to safely handle guns! The horror!
"Really didn't like. I thought it was nasty and mean-spirited. ""[NAME]"" on ice it isn't."
"Yup, it all starts with [NAME]. He’s not the worst owner in the nfl, but he’s in the bottom half for sure. "
Unbelievable! Here. Have your iPad back. Not interested in being treated like a criminal. I’ll write home with pen and paper
"Because all they care about is themselves, and maybe their immediate family. Its the libertarian ethos - gimme gimme and fuck everybody else."
"She want to take it slow, I can see that... I deal with those girls all the time, they my favorite "
"Unfortunately on my end, it’s only pecks during sex. Pretty boring. Never open mouthed or anything like that. "

Block him and stop replying to his comments. Not worth it.
"This is more like Instant Karma. The schadenfreude is strong with me, here! Wish I could upvote this twice! :)"
Who even are you? Get off the Internet little boy. I don't have time for you
So many great shows they killed because they didn't advertise them and put them at terrible air times :(
"Imagine being this upset about another man’s marriage, someone you don’t know personally mind you. "
Don't let a few hard months get in the way of a possible beautiful future.
It's practically non existent. Im mostly afraid to initiate a hug because I'm afraid I don't know/forgot how to hug.
I was expecting the top comment to be the copypasta. Glad to see that wasn’t the case.
"Pretty big signs that something can be pretty fun and effective when you get these same shitty, selfish teammates."
[NAME] game sucks. He's good at comps but his strategic game is awful
No. Spend all of it ASAP. Spend the evidence so you can get rid of it quickly and safely while also still being able to buy shit!
>[NAME] Well he forgot to save me from the 'word of hella'.
"You can thank [NAME] for that. He wouldn't commit to taking [NAME]. He wanted to play for [NAME]. He shunned uncertainty, not the Jets."
I get Botox for migraine and my eyebrows don’t do this ... she looks like she is on drugs .

Im about to order 1b-lsd today since thats all i can get here legaly and dont have underground conections to get real acid. I will keep that in mind :D
Cold approach is a huge waste of time due to the ratio of success-failure
I think this title is biased. It groups all media improperly.
"I stand corrected. As I said, wonderful charities. I will always enjoy GDQ, just not revalant to my experience."
This is surprising as many pizza places us peanut oil on the crust in the past. Had a friend end up in the hospital from this.
CBA's app is atrocious. I had to set it up on my mother's new iPhone and it was a nightmare.
I don't like football but the 10 minutes of actual football has been pretty entertaining so far
Wow got em you know [NAME] made the same mistake ?
I actually have the complete collection so I can play any of them when I want to!
I kiss the shade all dude. His username was trewdat. I miss that guy.
"Democrats never had complete control, that is a common misconception/lie."
Me too. Scorpion sounds so odd now
"Some people are pretty dense. That comment was clearly sarcasm, sorry bout your downvotes 😔"
Full time tennis fans are pompous and annoying.
"Yet somehow that doesn't make death threats any less scary, because of the fear the 0.00001% of them will try to follow through on that threat."
I’m sorry he’s treating people this way. You will find even greater and less costly bliss!
One. We are unlikely to survive long enough to make it to our second kill.
OMG. The company logo reminded me of something. AAAAAAAAAAAH.
"The finest example of an egotistical, ignorant and racist piece of trash. Humans like this disgust me."
I am really disappointed in everyone today. Not a single murmur was mentioned. People only murmur in [NAME] world.
We may destroy the rest of the world in the process.
You come off as very cold and uncaring there.
None at all. I dont like kids and dont want them. I got a vasectomy and it's a done deal. Zero regrets
That isn't the ideal female body nor is it /fit/ That's a fetish
"Low effort bait, not even creative or funny."
"you are correct, but now it is over. and i cry"
You're just upset because it accurately highlights the absurdity of the minimum wage.
it depends on the page you moron.
It really is! I loved everything about it. I'm so happy my friend told me about the franchise :)
I live an hour from one but was afraid of driving all the way there and them telling me that I have to order one.
Ohhh you're an incel. Your opinion doesn't matter. Back in your hole smeegle
"I'm definitely feeling like it's been a never ending hurting fest, so I hope you're right."

"But really though, it really contextualizes how bad this coaching search has been that the Rams' QB coach is the only guy we can be optimistic about"

That's not what diffusion is at all smh
At least I dont care about any of them.

"If you think that you're ready for a relationship, go ahead. As long as you're not stepping on anyone."
"Did you play Origins? I absolutely loved it, I’ve had reservations on getting Odyssey and I missed the sale on Xbox."
How mature of you. Resorting to name-calling is delightfully childish. I expected nothing less.
She doesn't have to pay anything this is just an opinion of a lawyer. No court ordered that.
I hadn’t seen it and appreciated it!
"True, but it all started under [NAME] and will get even worse if Labour manages to get into government. "
I know what you mean. I'm actually looking for a [NAME] irl. That's hard to find...
That host's sense of superiority and childish sarcasm is so terrible that it physically hurts.
"Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
"He missed my personal favorite of ""harridan"" though. "
"Seriously, it really made me happy! I hope when OP scrolled through she felt a little tingle of happiness too."
"They understand alright, they just don't give a shit. Bunch of fucking scum."
People are idiots! No one should shame [NAME] for doing her job as a mom! Shame [NAME] instead for putting her kids' life in danger!
It's kinda sad knowing that ibises are only scavenging our bins & rubbish due to their natural habitats drying out.
And spending extravagant amounts on campaigning to impress the poor fools with the money that could have been used to improve their lives.
They should be liable for this abuse. It’s just insane!
"Man, [NAME] is having a heck of a career! In the end, he'll be repping us<3"
"I tried Skelth, it's pretty old and feels like not too active anymore."
[NAME] forbid someone make a joke around YOU
Well who knows what valve thinks. I don’t like Lyrical and Maut either.
Also it looks like this person might have a mustache. They look like they shaved their upper lip kind of mustache. I'm very confused.
A sharp stick? I think you need a rifle to kill that bastard
Bad execution but it made me smile through the cringe. The sentiment is definitely relatable.
Hell yeah if it were me I would be cheesing ear to ear!
I’ve been kicked in the leg my foots been stamped on. I can’t imagine the pain of this
"Eh, some people grow up, get tired of banging their heads and decide to start using them instead 😜"
I can't really provide anything to you that you haven't already deliberately misread yourself. I can't force you to be honest.
>the women's march chairs are so left wing they took a picture with LF.
The sin was refusing to impregnate his brother's widow when [NAME] directly told him to. It's not just about wasting semen.
I didn’t like that blue & yellow until you said [NAME].
...what? You're far more concerned with the o line than signing [NAME].
[NAME] sorry it was rude not to @ you lol
Ummm mdma or x would never make someone this violent. She was under the influence of something cut with meth
I’m too poor to watch this 🙈😂
I didn't mean for that to sound racist I just mean those [NAME] in the article
"Think its time you let your butterfly self out, dear...."
Arguing a player is the GOAT among every position is just a dumb argument to even begin with when it comes to football.
if they did I'd expect it'd be 50% more than a local store. The prices in their duty free are generally bad
[NAME] just put a huge hole in my heart.
"Yeah I know what you meant. Fuck the police, most of them are vile pieces of shit, they deserve every kick in the back they get."
"Makes sense, I don’t think I called out to them ever. Thanks. "
WHY IS THERE WOMAN ON MY ENTERTAINMENT??????????
You are unfortunately far and few between.
We don't lmao. Anything with humans will have the same problems.

Why not touch them? then don't shove people out of lifts. that's hardly civil. just WAIT and let people get off.
"Crazy how you could interchange ""husband"" with ""child"" and it would work the same. Ugh. "
To bad they didn’t SHOOT the low life😡😡😡😡
But not to the folks screwing him at the gas department.
80% of the country is putting their faith in a man who doesn’t even have personal awareness of where he is.
I am so so happy for you. <3
Ah yes I used to enjoy those. Before the dark times. Before the days of a FOX less Netflix.
the older me would be scared shirtless knowing all the fireworks that exploded nearly in my hand as a kid
Tbf I don't think you can get much snakier than wishing for someone's pet to die

I'm so glad [NAME] is better looking than how he's depicted in UFC EA 3
yikes i thought it was just a joke transformer [NAME]
Let's be honest here if [NAME] played last night the Canucks win. This defense is a major concern and needs a complete overhaul this offseason.
"...oh goddamn it, that's in my sales territory."
There is a startling lack of empathy in this thread.
Banned or moved to different platforms mostly. Never were that many and those that did post here had trouble following the rules and were downvoted heavily.
"Even worse: ""Share something interesting about yourself."" Suddenly I become the most boring person ever to exist."
"And any form of bottom up government is also extremely susceptible to corruption. Basically, humans suck. "

"What? They all look entirely different. Yes, they are all handsome, masculine men, but that's it."
"If you really think that pro-lifers think sperm are ""potential children"" you severely misunderstand their worldview."
The double standard. Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy.
No love for [NAME]. Team MVP is [NAME] but [NAME] deserves the offensive MVP he was a game changer when healthy and was electric.
I'm not a health threat. I'm vaccinated and have no children. Thanks again for your uninformed analysis.
I needed this laugh like... damn. This comment is just as good as the OP and the OP is pretty amazing. 🙌
"i don't think we really need to sign anybody to replace [NAME] assuming that pulls through, we can go small ball with [NAME] at the 4 or [NAME]"
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **8th Cakeday** [NAME]! ^(hug)
Then don’t read it. You don’t have to make a salty comment.
"Ah u/The_White_Baron... I didn't read all of it, but glad I know the reference now"
It feels weird reading a VICE article talking about itself in the third person.

That...that was way more disturbing than the top level sub. What the fuck?
Arrg. I never should have let my mother in via SMS. At least it's only SMS.
Its distasteful to complain about male-dominated space like stem? **pearl clutching intensifies**
"I don't date women who smoke. As for pills or syringes etc, I don't find recreational drug users attractive. Similarly for being drunk."
That isn't really true if you've watch all Arsenal games this season.

Taking a 2-0 in any WTA match is asking for a heart attack. Not necessarily bad though.
Well it was just an educated shot in the dark but glad to help 😊

I didn't know operation was a failure to be honest lol just knew what it was
This obviously led to your slow downward spiral into apostasy. The spirit never returned after skymall destroyed your testimony. 😜
It's definitely not that simple mate! It would be nice if it were. Where's the part about inflating your way out of trouble for example?
Tell him he needs to go to rehab or he’ll be kicked out.
Went on a date with someone whose 8 years older than me. She didn't realize I was only 20. Whoops.
Don't you even dare try to put any blame on [NAME]
I got an unsolicited text from wal-mart earlier today and I almost went into orbit. Spam texts are completely unacceptable.
> [NAME] is terrible at finding obscure crap like this Have you ever tried google? ^^^:^^^P
I don’t want my tax dollars going to some psycho who thinks he’s a girl trapped in a mans body
That's because there are a lot of other attrocities that have happened since then. [NAME] aren't the only ones facing discrimination.

"As a vegan, I can't tell you how happy I am to find any restaurant with vegan options! That man should be showering you with gratitude."

I'm glad you had such a positive experience on the sub and congrats on the relationship.

"Ooh, that's interesting info actually (*heads to capfriendly to check how many years until [NAME] is a UFA*)"
I watched the whole thing. I miss that style of cartoon. Simultaneously silly and understated.
Clouds aren’t pale they’re translucent but ok 👌🏽
I'm so tired I read anti neurons as anti lemons for some reason
I feel the same on [NAME]. She's trying too hard to be hard-hitting etc. Thought she was poor on Thursday.
"Maybe, I'm just saying that there are players with more talent out the gate than him."
I for one am happy for [NAME] ballin out. Now let's go win this game !!!!
Not sure how you got that outta my post. I play a lot of non-meta stuff all the time just because I find it fun or challenging.
yes!!! Once I realized my body wasn't wanting as much food i put my self on intermittent fasting and i love it
Just keep it. You’re going to go through more brain damage than it’s worth.

HR is there to protect the company. Not you.
Thank you!! I really enjoyed the first song and the song by The Avalanches. Both were very melodious and charming.
Horrible how they just invade your space anytime any place.

"Wow your sister is in abusive relationship, cool. "
"You armchair analysed it, and were entirely wrong. Literally none of what you said was true, because it was all pretend. "
"It seems hazy, and there’s been conflicting messages"
[NAME] should have come back. I'm surprised you could get any worse than the s10 one but shit i was wrong.
What the fuck Edit: YOOOO I SWEAR MY DOOKU JUST SAID ONE OF HIS EMOTES IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
i was leaving areal comments not pormotions but acctually i was leaving many
To bad they didn’t SHOOT the low life😡😡😡😡
Discuss and follow a case an onsessibg per the case are different. It's odd. It's the only conviction on earth where we see this.
"i wouldn't call that passive aggressive at this point, it's flat out aggressive and i love it."
"The world is backwards, nowadays. Where people defend _GaNgStAs_ because it's culturally and politically correct, and then shame those who protect and serve. Makes me bleed rage."

I was just a little disappointed that there is no audible/visible reaction by the character when visiting the graves (also trying to avoid spoilers).
Crazy how quick people are to forget.
[NAME] man..... I hope this is just one of his overdramatic moments on the floor... He's scared me like 5 times this year....
"What an ugly shade [NAME] used to dye his hair. Well, I guess it matches the infamous shirt."
"I just realized, what point are you trying to argue here? Because I have no idea where you're trying to go with this conversation."
[NAME] has only missed a couple games and WCJ hasn't missed any. Not sure how you rank their top 4.
"Like it was over wayyyyy too fast for a real one. Shit, the Taliban lasted for years, and ISIS is still a huge problem."
Doesnt help [NAME] was right. That would further push [NAME] into his arms
The same comedy bit [NAME] has disavowed because it's used almost exclusively in circumstances like this? It's an awful and weak explantation.
its not the best but i think its better than the american system. rn i am only studying three subjects so i like that about it lol.
"Then yeah, not really. I can't think of a specific type of evolutionary pressure that would lead us to developing an ability like that."
Oh good god. This is not what makes someone Minnesotan. Or backtrack. This might be the exact type of post that makes someone look Minnesotan.
"No dude. This person has two sick kids and is taking you back to their place... yeah, just no. "
"Nah, some cake sniffers were enjoying the books way before."
Oh the joys of Marine Corps boot camp!!
sorry. I don't want to put words in your mouth.
"Wow your sister is in abusive relationship, cool. "
You have nothing to feel bad about. It sounds like he needs to grow up and start paying his way.
hes leaving anyway might as well trade him bro
should've rolled into battle with a sword brad. that would have fuckin' rocked
I recently won a match going 12/19. Always ends the same way you thanking them profusely and them being slightly annoyed.
that doesn't make any sense at all.

Ha me too. I’m afraid we’ve been called out
Weird as I do know I've seen CoC waste/recycling services trucks picking up bins as early as 6:30AM.
It wouldnt. Legalization would drive consumers towards legal vendors.
"That's a lot of words to say ""I'm upset that women don't want to date me."""
I could be completely crazy but didnt they attempt a coup like 2 years ago and it failed?
"Hate the taste, switched to a plastic nalgene bottle"
Then why are you commenting on a thread about that article?
"Guess this ""grown man"" had to run back to his safe space because words hurt his feelings."
That sucks I'm sorry. Ive always been dismayed at how flippant people are.
CONGRATS! So happy for you. May life treat you kindly from now on.
[NAME] just ripped his jersey. He’s frustrated as hell right now
"correct me if i’m wrong but when [NAME] eliminates [NAME], she technically has a better track record than [NAME]?? i’ll fucking cry"
I remember running into teachers at the grocery store or whatever when I was a little kid and having that same feeling!
This has to be made as a satire of terrible memes . Like r/okbuddyretard material
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **8th Cakeday** The_Fuzz_damn_you! ^(hug)
Hes not the best at communication which is a big red flag in my book
Especially hard last night looking at Snapchat stories.

I can tell you professionals didn’t do it that way in 2009.
RNG gear is a solid no from me.
Yes. You fucking troll me every time. Fuck you.
I should have known what awaits behind the oilymama hashtag and yet I searched. Now I’m sad.
A little girl recently died because her parents refused to get her medical treatment and insisted [NAME] would heal her.
"Ha, I just saw that highlight. nasty"
Yeah that's where my eyebrow went up. The liability issues alone would make it a non-starter.
"Don’t do a long distance thing, not worth it and a waste of time"
You are not wrong. I have learned about myself alot while on drugs. Sometimes it's scarry when i find out how limited my mind is.

My poor space bar takes an awful bashing with all the pausing in a Squidge vid
"Doesn't matter how much experience you have, you're still delusional and most likely attracted to the ""wrong"" kinds of men"
I wasn’t even expecting the reply that’s why I’m literally bamboozled.
Same thing happened (to a slightly lesser degree) with [NAME] last year and it made for a lot of heartbreak that some never quite got over.
"Beat me to it. Just because the news makes it seem like there is a pandemic of school shootings, it is exceedingly unlikely to happen."
That's not an explanation of why it would be undemocratic.
He lost his shoes. He’s legally dead.
At least you're allowed back in. A bunch of us got mass bumped off and they still wont let any of us know what we actually did
I just mean symbolically it's weird to call your own flesh a 'blanket'.

I'm so glad you weren't physically hurt

"Yeah, that’s what I meant. My bad."
"I mean, I’m an occasional monarchist myself. That doesn’t mean I’m under some delusion that it’s a fix all."
The irony that most of these disgusting things wouldn’t have made it through the winter without vaccines
"Welp. That sucks. I always check left and right when crossing an intersection, getting T-boned is one of my biggest fears."
">How can I hate [NAME] I like [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]? And [NAME]"
Delete this. Half the fun is spending five minutes convincing someone to get down on the floor and look through a couple holes.
Hi from a fellow INFJ weirdo. :-) Good luck juggling two suitors!
. The only thing that matters is that [NAME] was murdered and those responsible must pay.
I'm with the photo guy. It would be an awful feeling to watch your date flirt with some other dude ON YOUR DATE.
Still not as bad as [NAME] not being able to figure out how to push a god damn button.
"Just out of curiousity, how does 4:3 stretched look on a 21:9 monitor"
Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways.
[NAME] is worse.. [NAME] is really bad as well..
Any differing opinion that exists is heresy.
What I know is you seem perfectly comfortable being a hypocrite but utterly outraged at the idea of admitting to it.

hey the 5 riders per van per day are upset
You should have said “might even have enough for a minute” u would have downgraded this to “terrible pun”
The fact that she told you your sex life is over is insane to me.
Who da fuck wears swim trunks to a competition
Beverly Hills. They did a whole season about UNDERWEAR. I can't imagine why anyone would pick Jersey in this current phase of [NAME] domination.
Edited because my kneejerk response was kind of unnecessarily harsh. :/
"A pretty fundamental part of talking about racism is having a conversation about defining the term, not re-defining it."
Hm... I can't help you then. I always go cold-turkey from any addiction I decide to quit. :/ That doesn't work for everybody.
[NAME] looking like his fucking controller disconnected

I would of at least helped the poor guy. Throw some fire crackers at the dam thing
I avoid them like the plague and report them
That's one of the only times I've ever felt bad for [NAME]. He was relentless and would not let it go!
>fabricated moral high ground The irony of saying that as everyone here jerk's themselves off to a meme
Oke thats really disappointing of him. Although his thoughts are constanly changing. He used to even be an ancap at some point.
the ancap ideology has spread to birds now. Our numbers grow stronger every day😂
"If the fan doesn't work, then I'm fine with it."

"I'm tall but no one is attracted to me, because I'm ugly, I have a big nose and ears."

It's also surprising that Valve released a dud game. Maybe it's time for Valve to grow up and introduce themselves to the digital communication age?

I dont think she knows that once your body runs out of fat it starts eating your muscles and organs.

I guess the caveat is that is a world championship offyear where not all players are available due to playoffs
"It would be a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
Do you really think anyone would support this legislation on any side. Jeez man lay off the [NAME] plus that would really destroy the CIA/FBIs blackmail program lol
They can't they need a morty dumbness shield

that is how you start the second half wow
When she drilled into the table [NAME] didn’t even know they were sleeping together. Her complaint should’ve been filed with Arizona.

I cannot imagine being so fragile that being able to smile threatens your identity and world view.
"For art? I think it's kind of silly, but it's also fun. Let people live :P"
Bisexuality does not and never has implied gender preference. Assuming that is perpetuating biphobia.

Oh thanks ^^ my bad I have been typing too much so my fingers hurt XD
If you think he's working 2400 times harder than an average minimum wage worker then there's something severely wrong with your world view.

What bothers me more is the picture quality of the donut compared to the steak
And I’ll admit I am insane for allowing it to happen but the passion I have for this guy makes it hard to cut off all contact.
Then it would have been removed. Don't assume my thoughts. I cringed. I posted.
I definitely get that vibe from this post. Or [NAME] was friends with them and didn’t get invited to the party lmao
The stress of electoral politics seems to be incredibly bad for one’s health.
"And [NAME], would again like to apologize for any misunderstanding."
Looking at this hurts my teeth but dot damn those roses look so pretty
Or they drop out cause they have no interest in learning the language (a lot of kids do this unfortunately)
"No, he's told me on multiple occasions he hates anime"
"Ha, my husband goes out after you guys have done your thing and checks for himself, he's been burned too many times."

It's not unheard of but there are certainly candidates ([NAME]?) who aren't quite to her level on guns.
I still gotta watch the last one. ☹
Getting AB for anything less than a 2nd rounder + something else definitely isn't realistic.
Child labor laws are ruining this country
I have cried in hotel rooms before thinking about the loss from discovering it is a lie. It's tragic and wonderful at the same time.
[NAME] gets way too hyped around here
I feel like the world just doesn’t want [NAME] to have the spotlight. This is torture for a [NAME] fan like me. :’(

Wow! That's awesome! Congratulations! Its wonderful to have hope of being off medications one day.
"I wonder what they'll name it.... I guess Chipper if its a boy, and Chipper if its a girl "

I love how people complain about too many midfielders yet still want [NAME].
I'm actually scared to find out what kind of thing you could get for breakfast there. I won't check.
I was/am the same. I'm the one pushing forward with the divorce though. The feelings of loss and fear are overwhelming sometimes though.

nah. YOU will get it when you're about 20 years older.
I'm 34 and disappointing my mother is still my greatest fear.

[NAME] “Good! It’s such a distraction to the team!”
"This guy hasn't learned his lesson. Bake 'im away, toys!"
So unsatisfying that it didn’t end with a pit maneuver.

Nothing cool about Infinite genders and Sexual confussion. Populism and Structuralism is interesting but as short term goals.
Omg lol at least now you Will be more careful before throwing out words like that. I would die.
Ah the good old fake dossier they admitted to fabricating Quality “comedy”
Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society.
It is so crazy to me that people unironcally use “kicks their trash”. I guess they just don’t want to swear.
Yeah I switched to maining NM in 6 as well and it was the exact wrong game to do that lol

"I wouldn't even call this a CB, she wasn't offered anything and turned it down. Still sad, though. "
"No, he said he's bringing in somewhere around 10K a month, not 2500 a month. That's a HUGE income gap."
What's even worse: the deciding voter refused to support the subway because he was strangely obsessed with a horse & buggy transit plan from 1858.
Wow really? I would think that UK bases would be the last place we'd have protests at.

It doesn’t look like anything to me.
"So many fond memories as a kid, with my Granddad, watching Boomerang on a Sunday morning."
This is where [NAME] loan becomes a bad idea. I know he wouldn't start but now there's no backup RB.

Bike snob here. $400 is hella cheap for any bike that gets raced.
"No, it's the curds, they just feel really strange in my mouth."
Yeah this whole thread is gross. Calling a little kid trashy or misogynistic or sexualized for liking to play dress up is just creepy and weird.

"I feel bad for house slaves, even if it's in their understandable self-interest. "
I've found [NAME] are more weirdly religious about their hockey for some reason. Maybe it's confirmation bias.

He acted like such a jerk- why would you want to be friends with someone like that? I would never trust him again.
"Welcome to the future, kid. Unfortunately your mom isn't coming."
16-37 and 25 fta. [NAME] is so fucking overrated. Volume chucker/flopper in a fast paced no defense league.
Re-educated her is more like it. I feel so bad for her. Internally she must be a mess. I suspect she will change her stance again.
doesn’t mean you could assume you committed a crime
"See my response to your other comment, but I'm glad you have conceded that your original response to revaniteanime was incorrect."

It's hard to care about a woman dying from giving birth when you hate women in the first place.
And you wonder why Labour get's a bad name for anti-Semitism with statements like that. Ok hun.
"Yes, that's what I'm confused about. Playing RE5 solo."

"I was shocked. They were talking earlier on the news about her losing by less than 100 being a victory, of sorts."
Wtf. And then we wonder why people think DnD players are a bunch of fucking creeps. Sucks that you had to bear witness to such sadness.
You have encountered some very strange women my friend...

I had some pretty bad diarrhea right after the game. It's was more enjoyable than that loss.
I was sad to see emails from multiple downtown restaurants offering free delivery through grubhub. Deliveries are going to be brutal.

I ended up with my kneecap dislocated like that back in the 80’s (it was a tragic hackysack accident). 12/10 would not recommend.

"The intro in that video looks like a sand storm on there, imagine a sand storm while playing GA on that map, it would be awesome!"
">Well, minus the interbreeding part. Eh, I wouldn't be so sure about that"
"Hey if any are left, I'd like to happily donate!"
We can’t stand for this any longer!
"Seriously, I spit up my drink reading ""The GOP not the ones threatening children"". I know a few thousand kids in cages that might disagree. "
"Man that’s cool, I like this sub. You’re a cool mod"
I feel like that’s the least disgusting option. Imagine a penis or vaginal canal made out of fingers.
It’s more like a bunch of vaguely veiled racists and sexists and MAGAtards. Unless that’s what you consider “good.”
I don't think it's that simple. There was a lot riding on making 7 and taking too many risks probably isn't the best answer.
Yeah I don't think [NAME] even had to move his hands for that one. [NAME] and [NAME] also destroyed the precision QB challenge too.
You really need to stop hanging out with those people.
Your coaching is terrible.... be ready and see how [NAME] uses [NAME]
Man. I can't wait until my life is so devoid of meaning I feel compelled to complain in a silly joke subreddit.
I'd say the guy who was going beat [NAME] face in is the worst character on the show.
This is a bad post and you should feel bad for being the author
"Weird, Tuxedo Mask looks shorter and pudgier than I pictured him to be"
Reading this made me pretty damn happy. Congrats hope it works out for you two.
Right? just like the shock I had in elementary school when I learned the KKK was started by [NAME]
Ok. Believe what you want. Have fun starving to death.
"Well, yeah, you fucked up. Drop this behavior and game her the normal way as if nothing happened"
[NAME] are not the best at being subtle about being incels...
Idk why you’re getting down voted I also pick it every time and almost always get it done on that initial skirmish
"[NAME] passing is worse than usual. It's alright, but god damn is it painful to watch."
Whoa I didn’t even think he was a husky from the first picture.
Only children are scared to take trains by themselves ...oh wait.
"Honestly, this has got to be the most reckless way to bully and harass a kid. Kids have a tendency to grow to their expectations"
"Word salad. You want America to do Afghanistan's job for them. It's not happening, those days are over."
I'm glad you had such a positive experience on the sub and congrats on the relationship.
U get an updoot from one sad person to another
"No, but it diverts resources from the art team, and prevents them from making content which would have been better recieved by the already low playerbase!"
"Apparently, he can't just have sex with anyone because he needed to rape someone."
"SHE. IS. THE. FUCKING. WORST. P.S. You’re not fat, you just need a stylist. 🙄"
If I say 6:45 they tell me at 8:00 that they’re not coming :(
"> Woo that sadness out Welp, never gonna be able to have a night out on the town again without this coming up"
she usually sits below the bathroom sink like a fuckin weirdo between 9-11 pm but she'll be free after.
"My mums told me about gunmen standing at the end of her driveway escorting her family to school, really shudder worthy stuff"
I got hung up thinking like this for thirty years with my first and only love. Don't let it happen to you.
Oh you're referencing my reply to another comment? I was mad at low effort comments and people who can't comprehend a simple point.
"Thats just dumb, u are stealing from people that just want to live a good life cuz other were unlucky, they were also unlucky by being born."
"Ha! Had to go back and look. Pens.... I was seriously wondering wtf this was, a giant penis-shaped gummy bear?!"
Whoever is breeding and seeking out these inbred animals is vile.
I'm not even going to read all of that. It is not mindboggling AT ALL. [NAME] is a huge douchebag. The end.
I'm too late to rub this into all the casual's faces. :(
"Match highlights for those interested, it was a very fun match"
Nothing good can come from knowing. Just let it go and focus on the relationship in front of you
"I mean, if A video pops up of [NAME] pissing on underage girls, nah, I’m not gonna still be a fan. "
You should be embarrassed. Not only because you are a adulterer but because you are a pedo for thinking of your son.
"WHY THE FUCK IS WES ON THE FLOOR, HE CANT DEFEND SHIT"
I love to see the Celtics give up [NAME] and [NAME] only to have [NAME] walk to literally any other team
Or they freak out if it’s “not the right sub” for your post. Like calm down
"Due to work, gotta stay legal. Edibles aren’t legal yet sadly. Fortunately not taking it for cancer though, just pain."
"In all seriousness, stereotyping does suck and I feel for you. But stop being a crazy horse lady and maybe you can change people's minds. Lol"
I don't like sleeping in the couch :(
I kinda like that AC1 is still untouched. At least for now.
Oh [NAME] this is going to garner such hate hahaha
LHW is such a barren shithole that I’d be more excited for this than anyone at 205 getting a shot
"Running theory is ""Schnee Dust Corporation"" but I don't think its been confirmed."
We need to end the nonsense of objectivity in teaching. Students need to hear how educated adults think.
My first Hawks jersey was #81. Praise be.
"[NAME] instead of [NAME] for me, but glad to see [NAME] is doing well."
"Translation: ""I have no argument so here's a rude comment""."
"I’m glad you had such a helpful person on the other end during a tough situation, those kinds of people are like angels❤️"
"I initially liked [NAME], but he's really kinda dipped in my personal rankings. His shot kinda scares me if it doesn't translate "
This isn't uplifting. This is *enraging*. This is what the government should be doing not nine-year-old fucking children.
"That sounds terrible, man. Have you been to a doctor yet?"
Shades of Akira / Ghost in the Shell!
This. Nothing would make me happier than the see the gNats hamstrung for the next decade because they gave a ridiculous contract to a hometown hero.
Modern buildings are horrible.. I’ve felt like this before. Stars and birds still fill me with a sense of wonder most often.
"Oh, grilled nuggets. Haven't really seen those at fast food places so I thought they were just the regular nuggets"
okay glad you have bots cause whoops
It's special if you're into it. Some women genuinely enjoy it.
It’s common in business but it’s nice to see an organization have respect like that (unlike the Stars owner).
"Huge loss. Good job boys! Now go out there, give your best and prove that [NAME] didn't die for nothing!"
"Yeah, if companies really wanted to ameliorate the lack of programmers they could hire and train more juniors, but that doesn't benefit them much."
We may destroy the rest of the world in the process.
"Everyone hates guys that talk shit and can't back it up, don't start shit when you suck."
"I think it's racist to call yourself or anyone European. If you're born on Earth, you're an [NAME], separating yourself is Racist."
Don’t worry about the baby but yes worry about your mom...
"This hits hard, sadly both of my relationships have been toxic so I've decided not to start any new ones until I start going to uni "
I turned the game off last night wondering what it’s like to have two point guards and being slightly jealous of the Nets.
So now disabled people don’t have rights . You get worse .
"I'd hate to see the [NAME] be reduced to a drunk junker. You know, like REYS parents are. "
Same. You run a progressive or I will not vote
"Do you have any non anecdotal stuff to say or? Also burden of proof is a thing, you made a claim, prove it or fuck off"
"Sorry, no punch line today. You guessed correctly on half an apple tho. Cheers"
"That's not really true, people judge all the time, it's just that they're usually too busy judging themselves to judge you too. "
What a snake. Typical Fort Mcmurray politics.
No matter how hard you scrub it WON'T COME OUT.
"I want a sense of progression and accomplishment in overwatch, something golden guns and skins dont give me anymore :)"
I love the comradely for finding the source
I'd rather continue throwing money into these foreign sinkholes than use it to mess up the healthcare markets any further.
I friggin choked scrolling up to this
"I'm two weeks in, hope your right, I'm loving the game right now"
"i did, but it was at 3 am before i went to bed, so i’m gonna cheat and count it as 2018 LOL."
"Its horrifying to think about getting separated from your family, friends and the culture you were living into somewhere new and unfamiliar just like that"
Glad she's not living in a bubble then....
Glad to hear it. You deserve your best life without that abuse and negativity.
This is one of the worst I've seen...
"Unfortunately you can’t control YouTube. It’s pretty bad out there, you just have to finish the episode ASAP. "
Don’t say that to a person with a rapidly deteriorating health condition
just awful I'm gonna throw a barbeque to get back at them
Right? Don't want to get my hopes up for a rumor.
"I hear ya man, it sucks that we live in a world where we have to worry about so much nonsense instead of just being ourselves. "
"I want to say I'm shocked. I'm not. Disgusted, but not shocked."
"im not talking about a studio. im talking about *people*. people that you're lying about, because you're an uninformed yet arrogant, entitled child."
Fuck pancreatic cancer. Kills so many and it barely gets any funding because all the money goes to shit like 'breast cancer awareness'.
"Sad really. Are they really that threatened by people speaking a language? We all speak English everyday, not like we do for sectarian reasons."
I don’t believe there’s a hell or heaven.
HR is there to protect the company. Not you.
I was one of the best. I used to get at least 50 matches. Hair loss made me invisible all of the sudden
"If ""everything is political"" then nothing is political because it's all the same. You know what I meant by ""political""."
No the limiting factor is the leader raped a young boy and paid his silence
"This is exactly what I knew would happen with that photo. Ugh, this shit needs to end."
"That's a funny way of spelling ""Don't make me feel bad about my bad choices"""
"Oh look even more whinging by a Brexshitter about how its all gonna sort it self out fine, such fantastic info."
Wow you summed it up perfectly. Where can I find one of these rare specimens?
"I'm not sure anyone has asked, and feel free to not answer. But is your feeling that the team definitely favors [NAME] right now? "
Weird we’ve seen leftist harass and attack elder people and elder veterans but it doesn’t become mainstream news. I wonder why that is
Nope. No joke. Also happy cake day
"Do you have any non anecdotal stuff to say or? Also burden of proof is a thing, you made a claim, prove it or fuck off"
He figured it out this offseason. He just didn't have any chemistry deep with his receivers and didn't know the playbook
>the silent majority This is the most ignorant thing I've read so far today
"Ugh yeah it’s really tiring. I’m in a public place right now and just had like, 3 mood swings. "
Same but I’m not really believing the OP isn’t a troll.
None that's why I asked. Glad to see your doing something and not just wishing or whining as that wont make it happen
The fact that this statement got downvoted shows how worthless some people on here are.
Just thinking about all the stupid stuff I did as a kid makes me very afraid for my 5 year old.
I hate when these crooks say it ain't so cuz it is🇫🇷😤
surprised he hasn’t mentioned [NAME] after saying [NAME] the best manager/coach he’s ever worked with
"Yea, and trading away young players does not make us better."
Power trip blindness is scary; how someone can't see the obvious aftermath of acting like this with their employees?
"Hey [NAME], I'm [NAME] ! :) "
Agreed. There is r/clevercomebacks but this is just not even that.
"Close the door, you're letting the heat out!"
[NAME] feel bad for ye no one can take a joke
I love you and I love your style. Nice work. Bullies should not be rewarded
That whole episode has some heartbreaking moments. It is probably my top Parks And Rec episode.
"Wow, impressive... And how long until it breaks and they decide it's not worth repairing?"
"The Japanese and the British can do it well, but they probably get like 10x the funding per capita."
They can't even really articulate what has been so bad since [NAME] took office.
I didn't mean the entire show is shit. I meant that season 4 was a shitshow.
I can shit on [NAME] and [NAME] as well if you'd like ;) Viva [NAME]
It’s pretty captivating in a make you want to throw up and then beat the shit out of [NAME] kinda way.
You can't argue that these are the same when clearly one of them has a monopoly over the market.
Yeah it’s the opponents club that should be scared of us! We are REAL MADRID!
Wow! What a joyous companion--for each of them. How wonderful!!!
I'm painfully aware of that having bought a FreeSync monitor with my Nvidia graphics card.
I actually enjoy watching this while eating
To bad we aren’t getting [NAME] vs [NAME] and [NAME] literally burning it down to close out mania. But man I love this belt.
"No, that’s just another way of backing a coup. Sit back and wait. If either side is going too far then offer to help."
Yeah that's not nearly as dramatic and aggressive as the ball in the above video.
Misandry is not part of our feminism here. Don’t make such comments again.
"This may be overreacting, but I would not touch those presents. There could be a bomb in them. "
Wow there a lot to choose from for 10 bucks or less too
I will take 10 more years of overpowered Tracer before I enjoy having Brig as a counter
this 'bug' has caused me countless death... i always used rifle primarily and switched to shotgun after rifle shot
Don’t forget Kylie 1.0 was in it !!
"Sadly, he seems immune to bans. He also dodges them with alts like [NAME]"
Some of them really seem to be embittered by their own paranoia.
Such a disappointment. Mobile games are such a shallow replacement for a full sequel. What a let down.
"""cool little surprise"" ow youtubers: NEW HERO NEW SKINS NEW MAPS NEXT WEEK?!"
That would expand his torso and ribs which probably hurts

"i used to work in that area. my god, what a complete & total sh*thole - and even then, there are worse places"
what in the actual fuck. why are they still driving?!?!??!!?! Love the kindness of the young dudes tho
Just keep trying. Dont give up! If you are getting numbers that is half the battle...seriously.
Wouldn't have it any other way. Fuck my DNA. Fuck nucleotides.
"Lol no, you said that it isn’t called swinging anymore so I was curious as to what partner swapping was called now."
Too fast for me in the chat room. I'm on my phone and can't type that fast. Here is more relaxed and everyone is hilarious.
"Wow, that was really terrible 😂 -ps, I have two really good friends who think this guy has deep wisdom 😭"
"Wow, they charge you to sign in the delivery too? They don’t make us do that in PA."

>implying Packers fans have ever fucked anything besides their siblings
It's actually remarkable how universally disliked [NAME] is as a commentator in the community but he still commentates at practically every big melee tournament
He broke the wheel so bad it's going backwards
If only there was a league of sorts of higher ranked play that they could watch. Oh well.
Now you move onto personal insults. Well done O king of the waffles. Once again using a word (nuance) with no context. Bored now.
Fuck her... don’t live to make your parents happy
"Says millennials are afraid of hard work, dismisses the hard work required to get a fit body."
There is irony in what you guys are saying.
But it's still....the geographic location of Arizona haha.
"I'm so sorry, please stay strong and know you're loved "
"Ooh wrong answer, but you'll have another chance to win 10,000 dollars in the lighting round! Will be right back after these messages."
And those poor kids are still paying for it. And we have actual grown adults that are bullying them even today.
Yes the achilles gave out and so did my hopes. I miss brandon :(
Oh wow I forgot [NAME] and [NAME]. I have not read it.. have a link?
I don't live there just have family there.
Probably out of desperation as they going no answers with the other made up god.
"Me too, I've heard before that I'm too blunt and I feel bad about it at times"
I sorry didn’t want to disrespect peep but as i said i needs to be dark and about something i like
I did those things in real life and I've never had a single nightmare. Face your fears.
[NAME] has a player option next year that seems likely he will likely decline to secure a new contract with more guaranteed money.
"Proof of [NAME] love for mankind, beer and dogs. Love both and abuse neither."
oh my [NAME] that first post 🤢🤢
Did not expect it to work with a body on it..
Typical Lebronsexual garbage channel. Don't watch video.
I was raised solo parent so it was more of an angry hushed whisper when they thought I was in the other room.
People are just so used to these laws never being enforced in any meaningful way in other countries.
He takes so much abuse...and i appreciate it's him and not butcher or severson tight now.
"Nobody panics when a remake goes according to plan, even if the remake is horrifying!"
[NAME] didn't finish the LPs!? Wow. I am in episode 20 something and was expecting him to finish :(
This feels *so* cringeworthily thirsty after [NAME] ridiculous meet & greets recently.
"You're a sealion and a leftist troll. Begone, and enjoy your ban."
"I’m not a detective, but I don’t think it was her. "
"AP can tell them to leave, and then call the cops if they don't. Soliciting/begging is not allowed on Target property. "
Oh my [NAME] your desk is fucked.
I can’t believe this blatant police brutality
I miss [NAME]. Shame he had to get injured while he was here
I watch it 4-5 times every time it comes up. I think there is something wrong with me...
What a waste of money and time
“I doubt I’m done writing” Kill me
And I call them alcoholics who can't hold a relationship together
I have multiple throwaways for the embarrassing or depressing things I need to get off my chest.
I don’t see the yes yes yes yes part. Just one big no.
"I have no idea what ""[NAME]"" is. These billion and one denominations are getting kind of ridiculous."
Pick one. - Socialism can't work people human nature is intrinsically selfish. - We don't need taxes because people will be naturally charitable.
"Oh my [NAME], is this the new transphobia specific ""Post Hog""? Because it really should be."
This is so sweet and it makes me so happy. But also so sad because I hate seeing families torn apart.
Had to stop and wonder what [NAME] has to do with this before I realize you wrote dumpster
I love lions. Wouldn't want one in my house though. Might scare the dog. Same thing with children for me!
i’ve heard great things from the people who actually saw it. Thriller is my favorite genre so it seems right up my alley
But this is a 1v1 game with a couple thousand people playing right. There had to be a better match.
For a second I didn’t see the t in “stack.” Was wondering how you did that but nvm.
I miss [NAME]. Shame he had to get injured while he was here
Woah so [NAME] was finally unhappy with the team? I sense a lineup shuffle coming
That's really sad. I used to live not far from there and spent a lot of time in that park. Fished in those ponds many times.
"It’s crazy how invisible, worthless internet points control us"
No but that doesn’t mean people were less happy in the past.
You and your lovable band of losers have already lost!
"Yes, they suck for making a profit off of people who are proven to be high risk. How dare they!"
WHO WON THIS FIGHT My thoughts: neither side did a good job at explaining their positions and this entire interview was mostly useless
Holy shit! Did not see that coming! Gonna miss you [NAME] :(
Because prostitutes clearly can't be raped or kidnapped. It's so horrifying that our society still believes this.
Alright we have worn them down enough guys.
>![NAME]. Apologies to the Hiyoko Best Girl gang but I could never get myself to like her...!<
Trial by jury of my peers is honestly my worst fear
You gotta try harder than that. That wouldnt even take a bronze in mental gymnastics

lakers bout to get KAT fucked now
That's such a selfish mentality to have.

"Both [NAME] and [NAME] were broken up, so it wasnt cheating."
"Sorry to say it, but you will have to do that for now It sucks "
[NAME] path made me hate everything associated with pirates
Show me one conservative congressman/senator who is actively fighting climate change to break this stereotype
"Important part of this, surprising it's not there. "
I would point to [NAME] razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
because people are idiots and don't like being wrong
No link sharing the pics? Mildly disappointed in reddit haha
[NAME] is getting very unhinged I almost feel bad for him at this point
Twilight... STILL a better love story than The Last Jedi!
It’s awful. I couldn’t even see the ending at all.
"Sorry, you misspelled disrespectful. You don't have my trust. Here are the divorce papers."
Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.
"There is such a thing as too big, but this ain’t it, chief. Any bigger I would probably agree."
There is no way around it :(
Bein' separated just doesn't feel so right.
[NAME] is Asian. She is also white. She has talked before about how she does not like people to erase either half of her.
"There are no words to help heal your broken heart, but I’m sending you as much love and support I can. "
"We, the fans, are the losers here."
"as a Ducks fan, this thread makes me sad..."
Because the hierarchy is afraid they’ll get burned.
"If you think NOED is OP, use small game, if small game is bad, your argument is invalid. "
“Spite-based refugee system...” really got me chucking.
Same. Not being hateful to the op but I don't see the connection.
A little girl recently died because her parents refused to get her medical treatment and insisted [NAME] would heal her.
"Wow. Forget the separation, lawyer up and go straight to divorce. "
Damn I can’t believe [NAME] beat up [NAME]
"[NAME] bad, [NAME] good, updoots to the left."

Looks like you got it bad. How soon till you can get out on your own?
i actually laughed at that lol good one man
"And a hell of a lot better receivers. [NAME], [NAME], prime [NAME], [NAME]. "
I completely agree! It's cold at first but makes you feel so alive and invigorated by it too. It's a total shock to the system.
Not enough. I'd pay $100 to not be ugly in a heartbeat
"No such thing as too cold, friend! Just too long, I don't wanna bother."
"Oh no brothers, absolutely no cheers from iraq"
Keep dreaming. He isn't coming to this black hole of an organization.
"i don';t know about that, it's probably aliens."
Please make a separate post that includes these territorial changes and not one for each village. Thank you for your efforts.
I hope The pelicans trade him and [NAME] if they trade [NAME]. Hate to see them waste away in NO
"Haha sorry, I make hip hop music 😂"
"Disgusting. This is blatant nepotism, and that man should be ashamed."
Culture war is a two-player game. This would only mean a different tribe would have believed the claims and a different tribe would have disbelieved them.
"I remember that. It was a crushing experience that started a whole other level of depression. But hey, maybe things will work out for you. "
Shootouts aren’t our strong suit. Happy to get out with a point though

A couple things: Fuck Nazism. Enjoy the ban for trolling!
"What I learned last year was not to read the comment sections, because it used to get me hot!!!!! "
I’m on mobile and I can see them. Omg it makes me so happy 😂 never noticed if before either. iPhone btw
I live downtown and walk around at odd hours of the night all the time. Love the empty and abandoned feel of the city.
Thank you so much. I'm really glad you found yourself. I hope to get there.
I’m sorry. Happy Birthday! I care ❤️
It would be really bad for relations between the two cities if we took Memphis' NBA team.
"I feel you, names are the worst. "
I'm a poker pro I'm a pro at my job so I can lose money at poker
I would enjoy Kreate a Kharacter. But it'll need a lot of help. They shouldn't let you put cubes and stuff everywhere like in SC6.
The amount of empty seats at the Orange Bowl was pretty bad
"You know, I'm rather disappointed, but admire your cunning at the same time"
"I’m really late here, but I’m surprised I haven’t seen anyone bring up the possibility of them wanting to eat you."

You stole an Instagram meme? For shame
"I feel the same way! It just doesn’t get better for some of us, I’m sick of hearing that it gets better."
You stole an Instagram meme? For shame

I'm worried he choked to death before he could finish the sentence.
Most of them seem to be the evangelical type who even think the pope is [NAME].
This is garbage. No. My garbage has more compositional worth than this. Hipster pepto bismol vomit looking trash.
What a weird and slightly creepy thing to come to mind as a reaction to this video. /s Edit: apparently indicating my sarcasm was necessary here.
"I haven’t been keeping up with MHA, but this seems like a real bad idea"
Glad I tend to post pics of my cats and not myself.
A girl that ugly only liking me isn't a compliment its an insult and it shows [NAME] hates me
I just enjoy using intelligent words...? I left him
Wow thanks. Didn’t know there were any others glad to hear
"Cut rent control, then increase own housing allowance. Because fuck everybody else, am I right?"
"Ah yes, the poison. The worst part of any poisoning. "
[NAME] is my least favorite on the station.
How unfortunate. You seem to have missed the point of being American in spite of everything.
"This, in top of my already terrible mental health, is the reason why I'm severely underweight and need help."
I work for the Hilton company I’m disgusted they would let this happen outside one of their hotels if they had any ounce of control.
"No, he’s been with more women than I have been with men. He loves sex and has no problems with an erection. "
"Sir, you have been warned. You antagonistic attitude will not be tolerated. Please try harder at being a model citizen. Thank you for your cooperation."
Not saying it's bad. It just initially looked like the kinda thing you use in resection to stuff
"Ohhhh, that makes sense. Cheers mate "
Wait for real? That's how they met? lol that's both terrifying and completely fitting considering how nuts they both are
"No, they couldn’t hav- They shouldn’t have. uh...this makes me feel sick 🤕 "
"Short, succinct, and perfect. It would be nice if the more of the world realized this simplicity of life."
"Yes, [NAME] is truly evil [NAME], his utter failure and stupidity is so beyond reason that when you mention it, it sounds beyond reason."
I don't know why but every time I see a meme telling me how good I am it doesn't do anything and doesn't make me happy
He looks like he was crying already about something and hes reacting to realizing hes on camera crying probably not his proudest moment
"Didn't even take a sip of the wine, and he still got wasted. "
For the love of [NAME] do not ever link that again
Do it successfully and coal country will still say it’s a stupid idea.
That's sick I love your setup! Have a great tour bud!
I once looked at the I-95 and was hospitalised for weeks.

"""I love animals but I hate PETA."" - [NAME] "
"lol, dude. I don't know, but thank you. they might don't care but you do care. So I'm not much more loser."
yeah i am using the regular blue black deck. But is it really that bad.
I'd be down with the big baller himself.
I am 33 and I still regret things I said in the 5th grade.
I always move back and always regret it.
They could have prepared you better. I'm so sorry. I wanna give you a hug and tell you it's okay.
Pull that sucker right up to your face
> they look like such fucking OCs. [NAME] designed them I don't know what you expected. He phones in video games all the time.
This is so true cause I always think “are they just using me for sex?”
"Honestly, I have a hard time sleeping in socks. The fuzzy ones are the worst because they slide around on my feet."
You don't follow [NAME]. You're a hypocrite following man's interpretation of the word of [NAME]. Youre too stupid to even be embarrassed.
Why don’t you just *get the fuck out* of Edmonton if you hate it so much?
"It may be weird, but I replay the entire series while waiting for another episode all the time."
"They NAILED [NAME]. That looks legit, dude! I might steal your idea, haha"
I’m not sure bud. But they do have multiple options. So that might be one of them
Can someone summarise it here? I can’t get past the paywall.
> extreme poverty is re emerging in the west. lol
That [NAME] missed layup is haunting me right now.
Maybe I’m cringe but I hate [NAME]
I watch it because I enjoy it
"Don't go rouge or stick your tounge out at those across the boarder, but perhaps you could care less because I'm obviously bias. :) "
If that’s the case then these shows really are all about messing up people’s health...
He is too quiet in games too often. Not to good at mid and deep catches
I never understood the real harm until I started reading about childhood emotional neglect and how much it affected me. It's very common with nParents.
If he isn't respecting your clear boundaries then you should block him and move on with your life. He's not worth your time.
I never considered until this thread that tone of voice is something that people find attractive? that seems so alien and bizarre to me.
She is still a billionaire. I guess stupid Tweets are going to bankrupt her?
"I’m a fan of them in the wild, weasels are interesting. Not as pets, nope. "
Damn furries. We don't have animal ears!
"Nope, nope, nope and HELL NOPE! "
It's bizarre that it's considered normal to intentionally brainwash people into murdering psychos.
I wish people like this would die in massive flaming wrecks
On PS4 it's very toxic. I would imagine it is the same over on Xbox One aswell
can I use I can't believe it's not butter because my boyfie doesn't make over 20k :(
"As a former [NAME], I apologize. That’s tough"
There were rumors for a long time to work out and I ended up making it smaller.
"Hey its you again. Dude can you please say ""N"" so I can complete the task? My last request went unanswered sadly."
"Or you just don't understand what fascism is, the role it plays, and the material conditions that bring it about."
"Yeah i know, i'm just stating why it slipped my mind, i'm glad you brought it up. "
There is nothing wrong with showing progress. Teams don't go from being last to best in just one year.
"don’t doubt us, we really love [NAME]"
What the fuck [NAME]! Are you easy to talk to? 29 years and you didn't see it coming?
Kinda weird after you find out he wrote those songs while thinking about underage girls.
"We were by far the better team - [NAME] had no chance on any of the goals. Bad mistakes by [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]"
Not enough that the median incomes for those without a degree to be close enough to those that did as to not be significant.
This spoke to my soul. I might cry 😭. I really do run away from my feelings
"Seconded. I had the December one well into January and finally just changed to the Sabres logo. Still cool and all, but the schedules were awesome."
"Seriously, I spit up my drink reading ""The GOP not the ones threatening children"". I know a few thousand kids in cages that might disagree. "
"I have no idea what ""[NAME]"" is. These billion and one denominations are getting kind of ridiculous."
cultural norms is an interesting way of classifying the sort of people I see doing ~100% of littering in NYC.
"No it's because we're ugly, short, and ethnic "
I love going out in treacherous weather. For real.
Same with Janus Portal. Countless times have people gotten away because the portal protects them from big damage.
"Had the item hit you, I would have asked security to hold them, for you to press charges for assault. No one should be entertaining that foolishness"
"[NAME] didn't contribute anything! [NAME] or [NAME], please come back. At they least you do something on the court!"
"Turn off your phone, computer or even the internet. It is scary to do but just for now when the urges hits."
"I have a feeling you're one of those far rightist trump supporters trying to use [NAME]. Your uncaring, almost sociopathic idealogies make me sick."
.... That literally made my stomach clench. I can't believe they are charged for the samples... Just eww.
Nope. Love them. What do you find gross?
Is that a little poot at :09?
"So, the cops raided my favorite massage parlor today."
She's supposed to be 20-something but is played by a 34+ year old actress.
"I was shocked. They were talking earlier on the news about her losing by less than 100 being a victory, of sorts."
Cheese Most of my friends love cheese so much that I’m scared to tell them that I can barely even bring myself to eat it
I'm phobic of needles and babies so that was NOT a picture I wanted to see.
"Bannner and flask are both viable for both sides, just mess around and get a feel for them."
"Could be worse, could be funky town"
It was believable until the “almost got beat up after class” part
Well [NAME] just missed...so there’s that bit of good news
"Oh my bad, i didn't know, thanks for telling me!"
"While this makes me happy to know, it would probably be for the best if we didn't post these things where abusers can find out about them."
He looks like he’s trying to blow shit up with his mind
"The happiest of birthdays to you, [NAME]!"
The jackets that we have so many people wore so they’re musty as hell
"Holy fuck, report this now. The fuck you doing on reddit? "
Randomly watched arrow this week and I think each year is more confusing and I didn't like it! At least [NAME] is still there and always shining!
I’m sorry friend. I actually used to be pretty good with this but I’m constantly getting worse.
I try to get close but I get pushed away. I try to back away and now I've just backed away.
"I sould have assissted in the stabbing, even ceasar would have been surprised by the amount of stab wounds on that little shit"
"Yeah that is a pretty crap and unhelpful thing to say, especially coming from someone who works in that job. "
You’re not alone OP. Stay strong. It’s rough now but everything will be back to normal soon.
Sex with men is hotter Maybe because society says it’s wrong
I have to cuddle my dog so hard right now.
I thought I could handle it but I was wrong. Good [NAME] was I wrong.
"Sorry, but isn't this a little too obvious? As the old saying, the early bird catches the worm."
Nah. Mine was wrapped around my neck and I am a gun loving medical student.
I’m so happy for them. I hope he drowns in a puddle of bacon grease.
Man I just stick them on straight away. Don't really care if I get some type of infectious rash.
"forget new buildings, i work at the chase plaza building and am a little bummed that seagram tower made it but this didnt."
I want to see someone get decimated by a [NAME] hit
And I though Glory Kills were gruesome
I'm gonna guess other people in the Texans org don't feel he deserves the credit you're giving him.
"That doesn’t even look like her! Except the [NAME] in the background, now that’s the one we know and love."
Your friend should be disowned by their family
Sadly there's a good chance that you still need a car anyway because that affordable neighborhood will involve a one hour commute.
[NAME] voice actor by the end of the game was phenomenal. So much rage and sadness
We’ve got the terrorists screaming [NAME] while commiting terror acts to thank for that.
I would be afraid he would come back and somehow blame me for his failure.
I used to do shit like this...back when I had a serious drinking problem I was in denial about
"As someone who could totally eat three donuts in a row if I let myself, the amount of sugar this woman consumed still struck terror into my heart"
Then keep your hands visible and fight the ticket in court. Don’t understand how this is such a complex issue.
1k followers on Twitter. Seem to have no sponsors. Not looking good
I took a picture of a farmer treating his crops with roundup yesterday.. it was horrifying
Oh shit. You’re that bet welcher aren’t you?
It infuriates me how many layers of tape these things have sometimes.
Nah. I think he will cheat on her like he did [NAME]
"I can't stand when a team member has no shoes, the sound drowns out other sounds for me and its just incredibly annoying to listen to all game"
"The government is closed right now and nothing is happening at all. When they come back, they might just be pissed enough to let everybody through."
Injury history alone makes him super unattractive.
"Ew her text is touching her photo, what a slut"
Totally fair. I would be sad in your situation. :( I hope you find it. You're not wrong to want those things!
I know you’re playin but it wouldn’t surprise me if I hear this for real
"Whaaaat no way, you can’t play it with other people? "
"To be fair, we’re still missing CP3 and [NAME]. This game has been pretty ugly overall though. "
"Srs it's so bizarre! There's often someone like ""OP is wayyy prettier than [celebrity]!!!"" as well. "
Hahaahahaaha I’ve almost completed the online story but i only have 3 gold bars so far lmao
"[NAME] has been attacking the basket a lot this game,good to see."
I personally think it should be illegal to let unsecured people ride in the back of your Bakkie. That section should only be for goods.
"I actually see this one a lot. ""Allergy: fire ants."" Me too, bro. Ants will fuck you up."
Uhhh... unfortunately I can't read the article due to some regulations...but pretty sure that post is just the article
Really weird how such a young child could come up with that.
This wasn't him forcing her to get an abortion or breast implants dude like seriously you are being pretty ridiculous.
He rambles like a lunatic and she focuses on being called “not beautiful” of all things. Lol Uh oh I hear the downvote train a-comin’!
time to stop concerning yourself with brexiteers and start worrying about what went so wrong in the EU before more countries decide to depart
I don’t think most people suck for 4 yrs and then figure it out again
"Limiting warming to 0.9 degrees from now [NAME] damn, they using a young baseline. Like 1951 or something. Were warmer than just 1 C"
I guess my story was too subtle. Alone on an indian burial ground after dark. It's literally the core of multiple horror stories.
Bye that's it for me. I'ts all over.
Every day in everyway. If I am to happy with anything next thing I know I'm actively destroying it.
"I feel like [NAME] was impossibly bad enough to warrant memes about him. [NAME] is just bad, boring, and too invisible to really hate."
"The [RELIGION] Church has been raping children for decades, that we know about. More likely hundreds of years. Probably since they've existed. "
Nothing seems to intrigue or satisfy me only drugs and thats sad.
The contempt from [NAME] in these threads lately is seriously disappointing.
That’s because it’s stupid and nobody wants it!
"I’m a crybaby now, but I’m so happy to see happiness"
"It is hard [NAME] damn work, making something this pretty look like a chump!"
We all are afraid of losing our jobs here or being blackballed all the same.
Yeah I don't think [NAME] even had to move his hands for that one. [NAME] and [NAME] also destroyed the precision QB challenge too.
"If a woman forces a man's penis into her vagina, that ABSOLUTELY IS a crime. Not sure what you're smoking. "
"> In some, cops fire blanks in the hall to simulate an active shooter scenario. That's incredibly stupid, and serves no purpose."
Same. Gives me the attention and love feelings that humans have failed to give
"If they were that good, she wouldn't have burned through 3 pairs in 3 years. "
I mean yeah but it still sucks. Hopefully you have better luck in the future.
It's not just me that has enemies for life then...
Just got the Ultimate edition and it's already my favourite game of all time. I just wish everyone could agree [NAME] is best girl
"Great story, but I'm on PC and didn't get a chance to play ;c."
"Thanks grandpa, it’s always good to see you around the holidays. That joke is hilarious every time!"
"Sorry, yes they do. [NAME] is the worst QB mentioned in that list."
He was in the merge lane and should have yielded. He was legally in the wrong.
"Well, I **NEVER**! ""Lady, you really *should*."""
Its the same AS to go to a bank and to say My kid loves money give him all of it
"I hate from the bottom of my heart, when animals behave like this.."
Cos Disneyland is too damn expensive for them these days.
"Sorry, I laughed, not at you, but because this is so perfect and so relatable. Hope you're past it or getting past it. "
"Did a lousy job, my dishes are still dirty."
Of course. Just know that I know that you know you're a liar.
People deleting and stop caring IS THE REASON why artifact is under 2k players.
Well im sorry that the truth doesnt clear up suspicion but who am i to judge ¯_(ツ)_/¯
"As someone who works in the oil industry with a lot of big ships, this is badass."
An attractive woman falling down and exposing her butt. It's weird that he'd go so 0 to 60 on such a thing.
Riding your bicycle down Powell is *a stupid fucking idea*.
"Wait so you can get an acre of rainforest for $35? I mean, it would be way cheaper at that volume but still that's real cheap"
"I got sucked right back into the vicious cycle of love-bombing, gas-lighting and degradation."
I'm honestly surprised. We should have fallen much farther
It's weird. You might be right to worry.
"A one-line whip is still whipping against, although it is a pretty disappointing decision."
Those not a part of the Austinfred bashing hive mind at the other sub will find themselves here tomorrow. 🙄.
"Dont worry guys, its all sanitary. He hit the wrench with some WD40 before he started."
The like is the worst of the bunch
I arbitrarily hate poo-lice Get OUT OF MY POO
So the watering down continues. When will the democrats stop losing the battle before it's fought?
"Just googled this, apparently it's like cutting off a human's fingers down to the knuckle..... Your brother's girlfriend is a scumbag."
>a Thursday night rampage that killed the 22-year-old officer and shot up a surrounding downtown neighborhood. Not exactly a constitutional standoff with the government
Wow what a disappointing game. Wish we would have showed up
My favorite browns memory of all time was that game !
Not really if they are busy. They may not even take a break. But again if they are regularly not responding than it is probably an issue.
Oh my [NAME] do you value 'freedom' over safety?!
"Not with me, no. I’m a true social butterfly "
I have a moronphobia. I'm going to need to ask you to step away as I have an irrational fear and distaste of you.
We needed some way to torture a guy so a religion can be created.
"Sitting here, waiting for the price to drop so i can buy more. I guess it's not gonna happen."
"Wow your sister is in abusive relationship, cool. "
Cali is getting rain this weekend so going to miss that
"Or maybe he does, and that’s why he scared of people thinking that; he’s afraid of people finding them out."
You post your pics online. Good for you! You're probably not a subhuman
Crazy how quick people are to forget.
"A data scientist extracts information out of usually very big data sets, applying statistics and the likes."
The [NAME] are all laughing at each other. They are divided. We need to strike them down while they are weak.
This makes me happy. Happy new year everyone
"Yes, and then look hurt when you glare at them for causing a scene and/or not being just as tickled as they are."
"maybe its because i have a pissy attitude, but i wouldnt have gone just because i didnt want to, since it was last minute like that."
"Oh man, I saw a White Forest Cake the other day and DEAR LORD I almost drooled."
Sometimes I feel like this stuff can’t be real life.
Confronting people with footage from slaughter houses is a horrible thing to do in my opinion.
This made me chuckle. I hope it is raptors v warriors in the finals. That’s gonna be a fun series to watch.
I doubt [NAME] could do make up as well as a drag queen. He's not really good at anything.
I found [NAME]!! That took me way too long to spot the watermark lol. Good eye!!
I must be getting old. Much more likely to be horny at 2 pm.
"College was the worst and the most miserable time of my life. Adult life, on the other hand, is the best I've had."
"almost every single time i have a friend from out of state visit, they make a comment about how bumpy our roads are"
I understand that they're meeting a demand I just don't think meeting that demand is a social good.
Thank you. And I love your flair. My toddler is the same haha
Fake smile always gives dopamine/happiness to deal with stress
I thought it was like a fake url sorry
Omg l live for [NAME] stirring the pot!!
Unless you have an established career and are a high earner then sorry but you _are_ the shared housing type.
Racism. They're talking about racism. The hate is the new KKK sheet.
Hey beautiful! Glad you had a great time!
Too right. I hate the Sun. worst tabloid out there
"this is epic satire, too bad its close to much of what the right unironically believes"
just read it... how do these people get away with such garbage decisions.
"Far enough, np. Its rough communicating sarcasm in text form, especially nowadays with Poe's law in overdrive. "
Poor thing. Her arm looked stuck in the crutch as she fell. That had to hurt
"Lol I know, gross right? I'm hate watching the tell all again right now haha"
Oof I’m glad this was the top post bc I literally came here to post it after seeing it on Facebook
Well two other close testers are really upset about rolling
It's hard to respect them as an organization when we hear shit like this. They will struggle as a franchise to win another WS anytime soon.
well that's no creepy in the slightest
but it's the music that really sets the mood
This is the worst I've ever seen. It really is
"He didn't ""die"". The dude behind pink guy doesn't want to continue being pink guy"
We have freeish speech. If you can be prosecuted for something you say then you can't in any way that we have free speech.
...But I don't think you'll find that delving into the minutiae of criticisms here will enlighten you. With respect to my STC cohorts ;-)
Did you really just link a study about partner violence and then equate that to the entirety of violence? Holy shrimp.
"Yeah it is, I hate it so much, I wish I woke up earlier."
There's those people that compliment me all the time and you can tell it's so forced and fake and I honestly dont know what to say
"His! Watch out! That cars coming straight for you! Omg guys she’s arguing with ferrah, she can’t hear us help!"
"Laughing at ""indoctrinated by traditional values"". Good luck in life."
I might be wrong about the details. But it is odd.
"i’d put forth that lots of people ACTIVELY DISLIKE dating and like being in relationships, so this wouldn’t help at all "
Then go fucking cry you weak minded piece of shit.
The fuck?! You're in the wrong subreddit with this regressive bullshit victim blaming.
The only sub that’s really bad now is the GKS the others are fine actually.
"I dont really know, I think its mostly because they just get these really high end computers and do nothing with them."
Yea but you seem to forget how bad we were last year. Worst year in the franchise history.
WW2 has the best supply drops ever
Ouch. Rough year for the jags. Where upstate are you?
"Because its the internet and people are bored. Its not kids, its full grown adults and you know it. Unbunch your panties."
"To me it looks like they were driving with both feet, as the brakes were on while they were accelerating... Something I will never understand."
Always been a Yankees and Chargers fan. Ask me how it feels to lose to Boston in two division playoff rounds within a few months.
"[NAME] was such a disaster at OC, I really don't feel comfortable even implying he's in Schotty's league."

Sex with men is hotter Maybe because society says it’s wrong
"I just got banned from one of his subreddits, I haven't been this excited for a ban since the snap from /r/thanosdidnothingwrong!"
Sheed... Ik but I still envy Horry
Because a lot of people on this thread are ignoring the pirate code and I’m trying to explain that rules are there for a reason.
Like [NAME] [NAME] yes but [NAME] [NAME] is super nasty. Whoever wrote the dialogue for classified needs to be fired cause it’s makes me wince
I was skeptical about it being huge but damn..
Just got done reading that part. Even [NAME] saw it in her dream and she never knows shit.
Getting AB for anything less than a 2nd rounder + something else definitely isn't realistic.
"Don't worry, when you turn 20 you'll look back and cringe, too."
"Yeah yeah science, but I never said anything about meeting forcing him. That's disgusts me."
This gives me anxiety and heartburn just looking at it!
that is the saddest damn yogurt ive ever seen
"If she deleted your Snapchat just because you showed up to a bingo, then it seems she's a bit of a bad person"
"I was looking forward to seeing the new predator, this (the concept, not the spoiler) would have made me dissapointed, yet intrigued"
I gave undeliverable perishables to a local fire department before
"He will, I feel like it's Christmas Eve and I'm waiting for [NAME]."
How ignorant of to care about the safety and well-being of others! Shame!
If you abuse a dog don’t be surprised when it bites you. Something something reap what you sow.
Your girlfriend is cruel and emotionally manipulative. Get the hell out and don’t let anyone else treat you like a dirty little secret again.
Are the ones playing now ready ? If so they are very terrible. Rather we play the players that are not ready
Oh good one. It’s insane to think the last three mvps were once on one team
I already like the game. I don't to make the wins gimmicky for the game to be fun.
[NAME] that was so stupid lol holy fuck wat
"That's not the plan. If it were, the backstop wouldn't be controversial. The plan is divergence."
Couldn't have said it better. Just did the same over my winter break and really got to know myself a lot better. Cheers to the new year!
Or just head on to Galleon's Grave. I just hate Dagger Tooth.
Injury history alone makes him super unattractive.
"I see, Unfortunately I don't think equity has ever turned out well in history. Humans have tried many times and failed with catastrophic consequences."
[NAME] Wednesday’s 😎 Good to know he’s enjoying the retirement life. 
One of those is not like the others.
If push comes to shove the easy alternative is you show up for work and take up space but don't actually perform your job.
"Ask her out for date 2, see what happens. Sounds like a fun spontaneous night. "
I’m so sorry for your loss and even more sorry about your mothers shitty reaction. I hope you’re doing better. ❤️
I’m afraid too. It’s the not knowing what will happen that scares me.
As a fellow shuffle/jamskater this makes me really happy lol.
Marry her or I will. Cause when my GF sees this comment I'll be pretty single.
Not necessarily. Simply giving both of them the legal right to choose to *not* be a parent would create equality within the constraints of biology.
I am just utterly disgusted by it all
There was a huge pervasive fear of nuclear war in the 80s among kids. I remember often waking up screaming from nuclear nightmares.
Yes get [NAME] almost all the way the fuck out of here.
We cant even get sexually assaulted without them claiming we're gross fetishists
All jokes aside my birthday is January 2nd as well if yours really is
Update: haven’t been banned yet By the way when I stop these updates I’ve most likely been banned
And then in a weird twist her family tries him for murder. Haha!
Well he is saying the right sort of things. I'm glad [NAME] won but I'd like to see [NAME] come back well.
"I don't date women who smoke. As for pills or syringes etc, I don't find recreational drug users attractive. Similarly for being drunk."
"Wow, essential oils can now replace oxygen"
I'm a parent and am telling you that dude is sad and insecure as fuck.
"This is very helpful, I'll dive into these links thanks"
"Mine is when my husband says our daughter’s emphysema is acting up. No, husband. Her eczema is. "
The saddest thing is you will never understand how absolutely idiotic what you just said is.
Glad to see that thoughtful doggo found a home here!
"Wow, i never really understood how bad the star wars perecuelse really are till this moment."
nope! she meets up with robb en route to the twins and he sends her back to riverrun to not spite the freys. little did he know..
So jealous lol we don't get to enjoy in TN :(
"Most likely, which, as I understand, isn't respected in pretty much any sense nowadays."
LIIIIIIIIIII🅱IIIIIIIIIIIIT. fat bastard was on sunday that i’m too lazy to crop the photo.
It's funny how he even has the same attitude in both shows.
How sad that you think because [NAME] wants something we should no longer want it. Grow up you child. Life does not revolve around you or [NAME].
I won't even reply anymore. That radio silence mid convo really gets on my nerves.
Really sad how often people don't go into the closest lane first and then change lanes when safe to do so.
"""Being able to attract women"" shouldn't be the only way you rate how good a person is. That's ridiculous."
"If people think that the current migrant/refugee crisis is ""bad"", they have seen nothing."
"No switch , option c) everyone comes together and wins in the good spirit of non-toxic competative overwatch"
All of their Saints are psychotic idiot who died for nothing. People remember them as horrible people in death as they were in life.
I'm surprised he hasn't already. He was charged on Dec. 31st but his name was only released yesterday.
"It sounds like that's what you've been doing, and Id assume any further reaching out would be treated like your previous reach outs."
Hey Man! Your house is on fire! All you gotta do is look just turn around and look!
Gotta keep losing to make sure 5th is our worst case scenario
I’m happy. Does that mean I can downvote?
So glad you got justice and closure. You can properly begin to heal now. I’m not sure I ever will get the same sadly
"Let [NAME] think about his performance for this 2 week break, god that was a brutal last 5 mins "
"Hay girls, if you where make-up, you can't buy me chicken tendies."
I can hardly hear you over those goal posts moving! Ahhhh the facts! They hurt! They hurt so bad mama!
"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one."
All I'm seeing here is that you commited a brutal murder.
"Everything he does makes me love him, including his video application for his job at Polygon which is art."
"He was off by 5 minutes, not impressed. "
Its had enough of this life and ending it all.
"Been to 54 countries at age 34. No debts, ever. Aiming for retirement in my early 40's. Life is good."
"Noooo. I seriously did not know that. Yes, mind blown. "
If [NAME] is lurking here it's probably definitely not good for his issues
"“WTF, He helped me? ...I’ll eat him last :)”"
What in the fuck? Now is garbage!
My wife would say that all of the above and another dozen more are cheating...and she wonders why I’ve fucked other women...
Predatory towing is getting ridiculous. I have up to date stickers for all the properties I maintain and have been towed twice. Fuck em.
This actually happened but no one clapped
You made yourself useless playing their game instead of forcing them to play to your strengths
i thought it was very coincidental that i was listening to 808’s while doing this bullshit and that this question popped up unexpectedly. made me smile
wow I think you've really got her now
I’M HOT ALL THE TIME :( pre-pregnancy I was cold a lot. This is worse.
"This is the worst meme format in the history of meme formats, maybe ever"
I hate when these crooks say it ain't so cuz it is🇫🇷😤
Yeah no way random bubbling would get them the highest score. Even in a 50 question test the odd would be ridiculously low
"But both lost, whereas moderate Sinema won. Its important because without Arizona there is no real path to Senate majority in 2020."
I'm so delighted that my boyfriend has found this community.
that was such a misstep from their PR. wtf were they thinking people were expecting with a public countdown
Lots of people suck on the show but [NAME] is the only one who sucks in real life.
"With the weather we are having, it is a surprise when a battery works."
"Thank you, I thought the plane in the picture was cool too. I am. One of the best pictures I’ve taken with my phone."
Now my mental image is narrowed down to a big imposing woman or a spidery woman that scares me just to be around.
This is the bus station way outside the city center and nowhere near the sea Edit: Unfortunately Turkey does lack aesthetic appeal outside Istanbul tourist areas
"It's a minor part of the article. Trust me, there's actually a LOT of information that isn't olicity-related here."
Is this the go-to battle cry now of anyone The Left disagrees with or supports [NAME]? A Russian Agent? Give me a break.
Not quite no. I don't pay attention to the leaks so I can't judge their quality.
"Yeah, it makes me feel worse :'( I need a real one..."
I'll second this notion. One of the first things to go is texting when I start getting sad.
Oh no you didn’t just quote tlc...👍🏼
I made the mistake of choosing [NAME] once. I'm literaly unable to change characters in Tekken for the rest of my life.
I fell like you're being willfully ignorant of reality.
It’s bad law. I wouldn’t be surprised either.
I have yet to see someone apologize for having bad english who actually has bad english.
Because the false accusation makes my anxiety worse
Thank you for your time and effort! I'm going to actively focus on enabling my Rein and tracking enemy ults.
"It’s been good, made me able to function much much better. "
"No, everyone should should stop talking about the rights of groups of people, and start talking about *human* rights."
I'm not a [NAME]. Can someone explain this to me?
Fuck you I was in the bed:/
One wonders just how awful [NAME] and [NAME] have to be before people will believe it.
"[NAME] i love this ""no one can be THIS happy, what a horrible person he must be"""
I’ve tried a few times on mobile and it never works for some reason. Edit: just logged on at work and fixed it. Feels good
I feel bad for that other little girl that was the only one not to get a puck
Wow guns and ignorance. What else is wrong with her?
"Dyscalculia. It's not that uncommon, especially in people with ADHD."

This is one of the dumbest things I’ve read on reddit this year.
"I recently came upon the term ""that slaps"" in reference to delicious food, or simply an enjoyable experience. "
This is why I have trust issues
"I like Sao very much, bit not because of the game setting, for other reasons. The game itself sucks, tbh."
"if we follow this pannel she is non existent and you are just allucinating, im sorry to bring the sad news "
"Oh, it’s actually its own thing. I heard goo and just assumed the worst."
Good. I'm glad that you are getting help.
Congrats and be well. Peace and tranquility to you. !
How terrible. Imagine waiting this long only to die the day before release? I always get that minor anxiety before a highly anticipated album!!

I would actually accept this being a fun thing to do if there's such a thing as glow in the dark hot glue.
That poor kid. That is going to cause some issues for them as well down the road.
yeah. it's like you know something real bad is gonna happen at any time. that's why I never try to get my hopes up too much.
They wanted [NAME] to be in the cameo and both to wish her happy birthday as specified in the order
Wow! I never saw it that way. Thank you so much :)
The number of pedos is too damn high!
> How can you hate your brother in arms? They managed a damn fine job of it in Weimar Germany.
Laws don’t apply when you’ve got money. Sad but true.
Great to hear that. Scary few hours for y’all.
Baby rape. Can’t make a funny joke about it.
" No mention of [NAME]? For shame, subreddit. For shame. "
This argument makes zero sense. The same tax exclusions and exemptions that were around when the marginal rate was at 90 are not around today.
"ah so youre the guy who shows up to the party with one goal, to yell at people when they don’t play by his own rules"
I’m to scared to tell them :(
Omg TDG has a new singer? That's so sad. I was rocking out to them in middle school too. Simpler times.
"Im glad I am able to help others, even if its just yourself. Stay strong and look after yourself. You can do this 💪"
"This isn't about football, [NAME] is a horrible dude."
"Nope, but I'm sure it was mostly sales, you can lose a lot of clients if they lose the salesperson they have a relationship with."
I guess you could say that it was unexpected
"Don't debate is probably the worst advice one can give. It's like saying: ""obey blindly. Don't question us."""
"This picture is a prime example that [NAME] are intolerant douchebags who will always demonize wealth, fame, and entertainment."
if you need to ask here with all due respect your the last person that should be on it.
I do this too! I love that giving a genuine compliment is easy and can make someone's day :)
>like it's a bannable offense A Singed man has actually been ~~banned~~ threatened by Riot for going support with smite and counter-jungling the opponent jungler.
My daughter attempted in November of 2012. She also still struggles. Glad you’re BOTH still alive!
"Yes, and when I do say ""no"" I'm filled with tremendous guilt. "
Yeah I should have said ‘wouldn’t it be ironic’
Woah Dude!!! I would be freaking out
"those pictures of [NAME] are real, he's on Crashing and the way he looked in the premiere was just awful."
"When I worked in salon, we could never wear flip flops because of “hair splinters”"
Awesome. Never get sick of hearing stories like that
If my friend talked about my girl like he would be picking up his teeth. Support your gf. Period.
Don't make me cry...P.S. Happy cake day!
Me too! I got scared that I've been laundry inpaired my whole life and never even realized it!
"Relatedly, my legs are lean because I run away from my problems."
Yepp. I've struggled to hold a job so I'd be in trouble without it.
"Ouch. Those geriatric insults are the most spot on, aren’t they? That and during my peds rotation."
"There were those god awful GoPro shots in the fight scenes where they had a shaky camera fixed to the actors facing directly at their face, though. "
I don’t understand WHY the [NAME] are so stubborn on this issue. They’re just like the [NAME] on abortion. Damn the facts!
"no, mostly just spurred from mild boredom and thinking of the [NAME] future. Getting a gauge at the caliber of players chosen at #12."
"Love it! It’s somewhat realistic. Maybe not that THAT degree, but I enjoyed it."
So far she seems pretty decent but I'm side-eyeing the hell out of him. His conduct at the restaurant was so bizarre and creepy.
No hun your husband is screwed up. The way he treats you is no way of a man of [NAME]. You deserve better. ❤
They love to prey on women that have just given birth. It’s so disgusting!
According to [NAME] there was no contact.
Id buy those shoes and walk in the dirtiest places just to piss [NAME] off.
^ This. You know the guy's a liability when multiple teams openly admit to taking advantage of his defensive inconsistency at the left.
If we trade him I don’t think be will be a playoff team :(
You already used that one my abusive buddy.
Both but which one being the most used isn't really important.
If you google translate it means “nugget” which I find hilarious.
Just horrible. Doesnt solve any of his problem and removes his strongest tool.
i think [NAME] and [NAME] used to be married then he divorced her when he found she was cheating.
"[NAME] damn it, I knew something was wrong, oh well."

"Me too, except there’s no hookup. (I’m so lonely) "
"My bad. Was half asleep while typing and couldn’t remember how to spell😂 I just let autocorrect take over, thanks! Lol"
I have no idea what that even means nor why you're being such a massive prick
I mean you can want a break from something and still enjoy it.
"I just got there and saw ""Chicken Pox"" When the image is about smallpox"
"I was kinda just silent the whole time, we haven't spoken since. "
Glad to see Mrs. [NAME] is still alive and well!
"The new beserker face ruined him for me. Made him another old, wrinkly hobo."
Makes me sad I'll never be with a beautiful woman.
Guys. Our defense is bad outside of like two guys.
"So just for the record, I’m with you on the football end: Love the Broncs, hate the Pats. 🏈"
This is like the 30th repost i've seen of this
It was received on Jan 25th at 9:22 am .81627 BTC and $3800. for it with a $600. fee. Happy!
Damn i am sad that got deleted
Imagine thinking this comment was ok to post. Shame on you.
"Just legalize it, already. Do it the proper way instead of by executive fiat. I hate the lawlessness—“the pen and a phone” bullshit."
Sorry I failed to mention I'm relatively new to the scene . Last 2 years only
"I mean, even happy-in-love, definitely-did-not-settle type couples still get divorced. It can go either way."

"The reaction is incredible. I’m quite certain it’s satire as well, but its impact is depressing as hell. "
Go to Happiest Hour before/after the game. Walking distance b/w AA center. It's a fun spot!
The worst is starting out in a new relationship after leaving a failing one. You want to fall but you know how much the breakups hurt
"Yeah, that makes sense, too. (Did it. Once. When I was like 16)"
My wife is divorcing me because I glued [NAME] face onto all of our family photos He looks good with her body

"Internet is probably closer to ""how is this shit so broken yet still somehow "
"Damn I got a notif from a (very cute) friend saying ""no u"" on Discord right before I saw this"
"Doesn’t offend me, I just don’t like looking at it. "
And you can amend a tax return. She can’t amend a terrible life choice like that.

Yeah it’s not like I want my cat to lick me in a sexual way that’s just weird.
Haha. Yeah there is a vaccination now. When I was a kid my parents did the same thing. It hadn’t been developed yet.
It had its flaws but I thought it was enjoyably campy and a fun ride.
Pedophile abuses kid. Kid grows up to become abusive. The Pedophile is blameless?
"What makes it a non sequitur? The point is, just because someone is in the DSA doesn't mean they are a *democratic* socialist"
I have and i’ve also shot some ak’s they’re not too bad but i still prefer handguns despite the kick.
Happy cake day bro... or ma'am. You have to see this to really take it in.
20 cents we use to pay in our small takeaway shop wtf are you talking about
"Yea feel sad for that kid, that native guy is an anti [NAME] activist who destroyed his life "
I'm most amazed by implicit suggestion that you still aren't showing any signs. i mean coming out should be sign enough right?
"INFJ hands down ""Being organised brings joy to me"""

Everyone is sad on this sub dont take it personally if you don't get any replies.
Shouldn’t really expect him to be doing well.. he’s a 3rd stringer playing 6man minutes
"Dude, I'm happy for you. Keep going, you're doing great!"
You too. Glad to hear your respectful voice again
"No no, you don't thank a bot you say good bot Also happy cake day"
I don't see anything about harassment in that statement. Weird.
[NAME] didn't finish the LPs!? Wow. I am in episode 20 something and was expecting him to finish :(
Because [NAME] is a man child who can’t stand up to his mother
Then go fucking cry you weak minded piece of shit.
I hope The pelicans trade him and [NAME] if they trade [NAME]. Hate to see them waste away in NO

This primary doesn’t deserve this nice birthday.
You gotta make yourself happy when no one else does
No. Can’t get off to my own sex.
It's ridiculous people blind fellow faith here in algeria
I love the way you phrased that. I do believe she is terribly afraid to look inward at herself.
Funny how we get more anxious about our heroes than their victims
I really can't imagine someone saying that if the gender was reversed.
hahahaha yeah you tell him man! fuk da police coming straight from da undagrunnn hahahah just like that song right!
No I dont think I said that anywhere
That hurt too much to watch twice.
Now my mental image is narrowed down to a big imposing woman or a spidery woman that scares me just to be around.
"That sucks Crescent City, I hope you get the guys.... "

"The owners posted the name of their two dogs on the page before and Cumlord isn’t his actual name, its just the page."
I am literally dumbstruck. Reality has been brought into question. Top tier YouTube comments though.
"not true! Acute acopia needs a brief social admission, social work, and tincture of time Chronic acopia needs placement"
That is not accurate based on the conversation i had with Mr. [NAME] today.

"[NAME] woke up, it was all a dream, he was really looking forward to King [NAME] visiting Winterfell. They had a good time"
[NAME] gave me depression because had I been left unchecked I would have bested him in hand to hand combat by age 16
I don’t think his clothing was so tight when he purchased it..

"It's bad that you're smoking weed. For minimal damage to your body, EDIBLES"

Exactly right? That's when I thought she was really really horrible.
I'll have a look and see if I can find it. Cheers for the info!
Have thought most of the game was OK with some bad calls both ways... These last 5 min tho...
[NAME] was a pleasant surprise. It might be something you'll enjoy.

Your wife is very lucky to have you. I hope my WS feels like this one day. I pray for it every night.
"[NAME] wore shoes and killed millions. For [NAME] like me, people who wear shoes have become a symbol of hatred and murder."
"That's even cheaper than I had figured.. there's still the ""to you"" bit... OP needs to post an Amazon wishlist."
SE 89th just north of Brooklyn St is one of the worst I've driven.
"Emotes have a ridiculous amount of effort put into them, which only makes the fact that nobody uses them sadder"
No because to them this disabled boy is faceless. It’s easier to digest our hate and vitriol without thinking about it.
"Just spend the next few months emotionally detatching, it makes the break up less debilitating."

"Sorry to disappoint, we are working very hard as employees to turn this thing around. Hopefully we can change your mind in the future. "
Are you actually serious? I'm really interested in the details lol
Same thing with Urgot mid. It looks absolutely trash even in LCK.
No. You have to have killed her due to negligence or the like. Manslaughter is essentially the crime of accidentally killing someone because you did something careless.

If they want to attack [RELIGION] they should be honest with the website title Imagine a [RELIGION] creating a website and calling it WikiChristianity and constantly attack [RELIGION].

He's only making like 3M more than [NAME] this year wow

[NAME] is the most useless phantom thief change my mind
Can't even put on dress pants now without turning back and checking for my parents.
"Made me so angry to read that, I almost downvoted your comment. Upvoted, for sure. Grr! "
I like to imagine that it's just the same 2 incompetent drivers who live in the area and keep plowing into innocent cars at that one fateful intersection.

The Babylon Bee article makes me worry for [NAME] comic tastes.
Glad to see [NAME] are finally admitting they are babies who are unable to take care of themselves.
This post and thread are killing me
On a college campus surrounded by undergrads. I feel old.
He hide his tears behind that fedora
Twice in that article he implies these minority communities aren't ordinary [NAME]. It's disgusting.
When are people going to learn that it's OK to cheer lead dance in front of an old misogynist lol
Hate them. I really don't need to hear about you pissing your pants in the first grade.
Now you know which cars to wreck into !
Do you have the MVP Giambi card? The stats are nice vs [NAME] but he hasn’t really performed like I expected
Sick comeback. Not really a dirty combo other than the unblockable.
Arghh! There's a dinosaur loose in your house! A dinosaur with Tippex eyes.
I've invested 9 goddamn years watching these twits. I'm going down with the ship.
I knew a guy named [NAME]. Always wondered what his middle name was.
nah [NAME] ditto is a bad idea. Unless the marth is really bad he's gonna get 4 stocked quick
[NAME] and [NAME]. There really is NO point of them staying and they are unbearable to watch.
"Hey! Go fuck yourself, you capitalist apologist bootlicking piece of shit"

I was told ignar was going to be awful by this sub.

"People have gotten triggered on this sub the past month if you didn't call [NAME] a [NAME], so I think we can handle it."
Play something else and come back later. You’re burning yourself out
Omg... Yeah leave him sooner than later... Abusive men can kill women in the long future.
This doesn't belong on the competitive sub; it doesn't have anything to do with the competitive aspect of the game.
As a white man on the internet I'm outraged... because I had to laugh and laughing hurts right now : (
I’m guessing you don’t take bad news lightly. I’m sorry bud :/
Hell it was made clear when I was in High School 5 years ago that we aren't playing a game that's ' too violent '
I’m not signing that 😂 dude can hopefully stay banned
Damn... that’s another thing I didn’t even think about it. Probably the biggest reason why people shouldn’t steal food
I was in Amsterdam two weeks ago and 400 sq ft apartments were renting for 1800 euros a month in the city. They have density but no affordability.
I mean hands down Rhine passed out behind the wheel with his freak bride riding shot gun
So unsatisfying that it didn’t end with a pit maneuver.
You can see they actually blocked them since the last message is green. That is so messed up.

"I don’t cry, either. It’s weird. I think it’s a personality/mentality thing. Just depends on how your brain is wired I think"

Wow. Did not realize [NAME] was a top 20
This is my biggest pet hate of all time!
"Idk, I just need someone who cares but I always lose everyone and I’m sick of trying to be good enough."
"Crating your dog is also banned in some places, that doesn't make it cruel."
There are too many factors at play to really say that. It's still probably disappointing.
Everyone who is complicit in all this should be punished and questioned as to why they allowed this to happen. Complete disgrace!

"Images you can hear, “oh my [NAME] laughter”"
You said that it is a fact that [NAME] is a rapist based on the testimony of 1 person. I merely stated the same argument based on your logic.
"Lol, thank you for my first upvote and for contacting the mods. "
I'm so afraid to weigh myself. I'm gonna have to do it soon though 😭

They were tricked. It’s not like those politicians were being honest.
What's with the buying porn thing? I missed out on it
I heard her affair wrecked his marriage. His wife saying anything about that would wreck [NAME].
Is this a real thing? I'm a terrible stoner.

"It's disturbing that this tweet got so many likes. Like, this is why twitter has a cancerous reputation."
No. You seem to still be completely misunderstanding what memory conformity is. Are you familiar with the process as documented in the peer-reviewed literature?
Nah I dont think the panthers are good enough
If the hot end starts pointing towards space you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today.
BUT ATHEISTS ARE DOING THE SAME THING AND ARE TREATED BETTER. No. You're just being a bigot.
You seem to be missing the point. Mine are imperfect which makes them natural looking and to me more appealing.
I've shit my pants walking home from school. Hour long+ walk
My favorite one that you’ve made so far haha Great work
That sounds so terrible. I'm very sorry.

This is my favorite [NAME] joke I've seen
I agree. She seemed to truly love [NAME] . [NAME] loves the life [NAME] provides fir him. It’s a sad situation.
You would know if you weren't such a Filthy Ricefield Peasant.
Never once is it implied that the birds can sense crazy people.

What's ridiculous is this stupid post and this asinine idea that white people are these constant victims
Really? Down voted for thinking picking up the phone in the middle of sex is crappy?
Thought [NAME] had a bad game. For such a strong player he didn't get to keep much of the ball when in possession.
The very worst possible route they could have gone.
Wow it's almost as if those losers have a lot of money or something else to leech off of.
[NAME] the amount of protection that you are wrong *because* you are an outlier at all.

I don't know why that omni-directional treadmill in Ready Player One still isn't being mass produced.
I'm sure the two young sons of [NAME] are comforted by the fact that the cops involved didn't want to kill an unarmed man.
Badass mom of the year moment. My mom has surprised me like that too. Awesome man
"OMG, my two favorite franchises and the two best girls!!"
Company car? Oh boy he’s in trouble now.
So I play competitive with a group of people and being the one widow is most likely fake or just wild speculation.

I thought he had a cool [NAME]. Was only slightly disappointed.
"Awesome, let's celebrate! Send the free pack over here ;)"
Sadly the Request a Book of [RELIGION] requires a phone number now. But if you have theirs it might work;
"Vegetarian, liked animals too. Lets just ignore that stuff about the [NAME], I sure he does not really mean it. "

"I've said it before, but yuck, kissing that bloody mouth... Watch out, [NAME], you don't know where that's been."
There was a commercial about men encouraging other men not to perpetuate toxic masculinity. Of course the Republicans felt it was condescending and anti-men.
No it's laziness. People don't clean because there isn't an immediate consequence and the reward for cleaning isn't large enough.
Ok so this doesn't seem like a cover given they made a whole comp for him

It’s a terrible thing when someone who doesn’t let themselves laugh has a reddit account
[NAME] doesn’t roll his ankle on a 🎾 in 2011 and we win a premiership imo
This has to be made as a satire of terrible memes . Like r/okbuddyretard material

The fact that they're flying their drone in the rain gives me anxiety.
You've described my parents who have been happily married for 36 years. You are good dude.

Do your research. Not going to engage in conversation with you any longer. Put your Nintendo away and educate yourself.
Give it time. Pain like that needs to heal just like open wounds. I really hope that you will eventually start to feel better.

I don't like this gif and that makes me a [NAME] supporter? My argument has not once brought him up. You are an insidious liar.
"It's a really bad attempt to get attention and make people mad, that everyone in this thread has decided to indulge."
Reacting to [NAME] at this point just makes me feel worse about the artist.
"But this was a supposed psychopath attack, which can happen to anyone, not a rape attack that mostly happens to women"
That was the chillest Sharks GDT against an Eastern Conference team in a while.
He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.
Yess! Some of my favorite lines from the trilogy. [NAME] killing joke monologue still seems very relevant today.
Agreed. I'm happy he was able to find a resolution of sorts; to effectively overcome the event.

Good for you. But ignoring [NAME] situation makes the article pointless.

Can't stand having sex with you...?? Just horrible thing to say... You deserve better!!!
"Just the fact that people constantly use words like ""incel"" to demean people proves that society is getting worse than it already is."

I would have laughed it off and walked away. Last thing I would do is ask the internet if I was right or wrong.
"Underrated comment, my friend! Know that you made me genuinely laugh!"
"Reminds me of that chick and the lizard, [NAME], and 7-11 tried to get the store number lol"
Maybe it's similar to how [NAME] hates cantaloupe.
"Anytime someone says “Sorry, English is my second language,” I already know I’m in for a well written post."
"Gonna warn you, that path is a lot more dangerous than you would think..."
I got a bad feeling about this. Something tells me they're going to drag this along until 2 weeks before release.
"No I don’t, why can’t you bring your hand to do it?"
It only struggles because it's released too late by [NAME] defeat.
"I have to admit, most of the worst people I have encountered in my life were met while LARPing."
well she went to prison for **armed robbery and kidnapping** so after learning this i could hardly give a shit about her
Two problems: It's not a newsworthy story. You'd get sued for defamation.
I hope you’re okay! I’m so sorry that happened. I’m glad I don’t work in gastown anymore
"I stoped telling story because ''[NAME]""*. Drawing makes me look intensely people to measure their ratio and understand their shapes. That's my new fun"
thats terrifying. how can people do that to their own citizens?
Unable. It's not really possible. It's not his only interest but it's the one I can't really do anything about.
I bet she smells like a jar of mayo left open for a week in the summer
And there I was blaming the poor black lads
This keeps getting posted. I think not
My girlfriend ordered Chipotle. Have fun with that 15 mile drive bud.
> Then and only then might you receive ~~a tip~~ **whatever change we have leftover from our grand expenses.**” FTFY. Sadly.
I legitimately want to brutally murder this person for saying that about us autistics
No. It doesn't. And a moron on Reddit has no authority to say that it does.
"> social media addiction is real Except, for her, it's not addiction, just a means to scam the morons who believe her lies."
You conveniently aren't speaking to my assertion.
I don't drink at all specifically because the next day is sheer terror.
"The real villains are those aware of the cruelty of life, but then reproduce anyway."
Hulu is awful for this. The volume on their commercials is deafening.
I used to have fun with it and didn't feel angry aside for when [NAME] was op lol
If this is real it’s just the best thing I’ve ever come across. I’m still crying laughing after 10 minutes!
Lol that's so far from the truth.
"No, but she's lived in Chicago longer than I. "
And I though Glory Kills were gruesome
The Wildling! He is kissed by fire!
I remember that! She crashed and they asked her to leave lol. That was one of my fav moments.
Think this is the first time I’ve ever disagreed with [NAME]. [NAME] at SF WCJ at PF sounds horrible
3h late comment. have fun at school !
"Dentist did this to me I hate it. I knew i should have waited until ""it wad worse"" but i didn't. I regret it "
So [NAME] doesn't do the social media anymore? Is the NSP stuff enough without a GG salary now?
"Get two, I'm not sharing with [NAME]"
This is horrible. I just have one question about your title. Are you implying that hate as a concept is always a bad thing?
It’s not you. These subs are terrible. Even beautiful women get insulted on there ugh
Translation: you should see her vagina! She can't fight you off! The double entendre is more than a bit unsavory.
Three year olds learn it's wrong to draw on the walls with crayon. I think you look stupid in this thread.
Yeah no way random bubbling would get them the highest score. Even in a 50 question test the odd would be ridiculously low
Me too.. which left me conflicted about how to feel.
"That's fair. Seems pretty lefty heavy, though."
That sounds terrifying. I hope you and the little one are OK.
Good to know everything is about average there. Leave it to H-Town to hold it down.
Bad RLM video? That do not possible is
He said “Guess he didn’t get the victory [NAME] :(“
What? I don’t just want to sleep with him. I want more idk... I value myself
We're in it... and now [NAME] is going to the bench? Gotta good feeling!
Conversion to make gay people straight. It's horrifying
That has to be the saddest nba account ever. Like 4 likes every post :(
It’s good dude I had to have it explained to me I’m just passing on the love
No. We wouldn’t have enough room to play them all and each of them would add like 10-15 mill in luxury tax. EACH.
"You know, 4 months of use is basically nothing though. In that case the bad part of the deal is Nvidia's decision to start supporting freesyinc "
"[NAME] I hate bad mondays at work! He needs to fiind a new job, this one is full of ”bad clients""..."
My gym coach used to make a buch of two pack jokes. This was before [NAME] died so it was alot funnier
"Definitely, I'd do that. The league pass deal isn't awful though."

What? The non-vegan burger air particles have clearly infiltrated the once-pure cardboard. It is absolutely NOT vegan >:(
I just watched the entire episode. They never once hint that they were having an affair. That information didn't come from the show.
They have disagreed with a bunch of individual calls but not tied it together
[NAME] thinks the carbon tax is as bad as Holodmor. He is totally unhinged and shouldn’t be taken seriously.
>I mean most of the native tribes beliefs are centered around Pleiadian star people. Nope.
"At first view, I thought it was a beer mug seen from above but immediately saw it's a pancake and now I'm just feeling dipshit."

Canadian [NAME] here to disagree with you. Politely. Sorry.
"Well, it's been fun. Time to quit YT."
Yep. It's pretty bad having to use work or a paid email and real name on a gaming forum.
"Whaaaat no way, you can’t play it with other people? "

Oh wow I didn't know this policy was in place in the 70s!

I've never been more disturbed by a dog

LMao what kinda stupid ass rule is that?
WHAT. It says due date 12/31/18. Did she have the kid yet? Oh [NAME] I feel so bad for her and that child...... nooooooo
You seriously reposted your repost of the same repost you reposted again.
You seem slightly sensitive... I was actually thinking we had been infiltrated by the normies
Nope I’m not exposing my kinks to Reddit 😂
True. I don't know the survival rates of the women in ancient rome but I can't imagine it was fantastic.
My relationship ended the first morning of 2019...Crazy way to start the New Year
I cringed so hard my vagina fell out.
I’m sorry to hear you’ve been cheated on.. but you’re free ! Makes it easier for NC if they found a new FP
I understand it but I hate it and I personally believe it promotes toxicity
"yeah while i cant even leave the house without being an anxious mess, let alone interact with anyone... "
Crazy how [NAME] sheds more light on this than Blm. Shame
I've been playing for years and it's still a bitch for me to lay off balls.
16-37 and 25 fta. [NAME] is so fucking overrated. Volume chucker/flopper in a fast paced no defense league.
"Yes, which is why I hate the term ""ranked choice voting""."
The only life that needs to be ended here is the life of the guy that raped your daughter. Abortion is just medicine
Sad to see this as a one-off. [NAME] seemed to be really enjoy the game and itself. Will give the game a try.
">[NAME] I don't know why, but that gave me a good laugh. Thank you. "
No worries. Just didn't see them. My bad.
This is terrifying. Good luck to you and your family. Hopefully they figure out who the creepers are very soon.
"Haha I’m not expecting anything at considering they’re 2,000 miles away from me. I’ll be surprised if she does give me numbers,"
Let's get things back on track! Happy new year!
"I'm glad it helps, best of luck on your journey. You've gone 7 days clean, keep doing what makes you clean for 84 more!"
"not just ""got hurt"" but nearly stabbed his eye out!!!"
I don’t care about the first seed until a week or so before the all star cut off?
I just want to live. You're the sad loser for going out of your way to comment something so completely stupid
"Oooh that's so sweet,she sounds like a good and caring mother. Does your dad know?"
Crazy how quick people are to forget.
This is so bad and I really don't get that politicians or party's like ovld don't realise this. Why block actually defends this.
Worst advice ever. This would piss me off.
That they wield to great effect to tell *you* why you’re crazy and how it’s totally not their fault
BREAKING NEWS: The new girl had to shred/chip a 6lb entire chub of Kentucky Gold ham today. Poor girl's arm ached the rest of the day.
Damn ive been hard on brown but he's been looking like 15-16 [NAME] this game
Such a sad way to think of life all because these people believe there's something greater than this.
"True, and so sad to see. Somewhere along the way, the governing of a country my mutual consensus turned into a national sport with 2 teams."
Former HUD secretary? I'll bet he'd make a hell of a brain surgeon.
I was in that phase for a good while until i lost it all later anyways.
I was thinking the same thing as well. Glad to know I'm on the right page.
Isn't North Dakota more important? Or are they just the sacrificial canary in the coal mine?
I am literally dumbstruck. Reality has been brought into question. Top tier YouTube comments though.
"Can't speak for that dude, but I'd say hell yeah they're a hate sub. "
Because it beats losing all your product
The Tommy Gun as a crate weapon! Just the worst feeling.
Everything in here I want but all we can do is pray to [NAME] for our wishes to come true
"Given that you're not a conservative and this isn't a debate sub, how about you just get the hell out and stay out."
True Story! That's the sad Part of it...
Its almost as if everyone is too afraid to be politically incorrect to admit that height and race are a factor.
Oh yeah lots of elitists who think they’re a damn gemologist but know nothing 😂
I disagree with all of what you just said but I am in the same booooaaaaat.
King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and Beach House are my two favourite bands.
I also love this decline in bch prices. Cheers.
Honestly his post was a little sad. The fact that it got upvotes makes me want to avoid this sub over the summer.
That's not an explanation of why it would be undemocratic.
"> Literally no one cares if you stay or go, Funny you should say that..."
CAN IT JUST BE OPENING DAY? I’m so sick of speculation. Let’s quit the foreplay and just fuck already.
That's one of the only times I've ever felt bad for [NAME]. He was relentless and would not let it go!
I dont think thats too far off. There are 200k homes in most suburbs.
How could you ever get bored of place that is getting more and more enjoyable as you are there
This actually happened but no one clapped
Lmao what's the difference neither one is refrigerated. People are fucking stupid
That is what we love to hear. :) We hope you enjoy the game and that we see you again soon!

Not even polite if they're driving. The road rage here is terrifying.
Don’t mind him. His post history is full of portion size complaints.
They start as needy creeps and work their way up to being dangerous.
Oh no my jimmies are so rustled! Please desist your relentless banter!
Omg why does this sound like [NAME]?
My kitten just got very happy when Pasta scored. Such loud purrs! I was happy too.
Deservedly so too. Tbh I think you must be the favourites.
"Yeah I've been finding it so hard to not eat everything in sight since Christmas. I'm still staying under my TDEE, but I feel nasty. "
Isn't the minimum 3 majors or something? I don't think he made the cut but I'd be happy to be proven wrong
Well that sucks. The disconnect reconnect and keeping your bloodpoints I mean. The accidental vs purposeful disconnect seems fair.
You took a HUGE risk. He paid....now be ready for payback time!
This sub is very very bad at irony
...and that's just the reaction to them introducing themselves
Buying Bitcoin at it's peak is the equivalent of people buy Fyre festival tickets. I'm glad I did neither
"Nope, not a [NAME] fan at all."
"Source each of these and trend lines from previous years please. No, listing a few agencies and telling people to Google 8t isn't a source. "
Damn sorry to hear bro. You guys still friends though?
I'm so sorry you're experiencing this. I hope the therapy brings you back your husband.
"Poor kitty. All you can do is give her extra treats, playtime and cuddles. "
Good thing I don't watch porn lol
"You can be gone for several months and they won't care, nor even notice."
Man at this point I'd be happy with just a few non-sweeps.
Also a tacklebox is what you keep fishing gear in. Not sure if the football thing was a reference to that.
Things were significantly worse back then than they are now.
Wow really? I watched a fair bit of KR Contenders. I guess I just wasn’t paying that much attention.
Ikr. Who the hell goes to Greggs for *pizza*?
You guys can’t stay married. Attraction is the most important thing if you guys actually think about attraction at all.

The problem is I have no clue where he stands as he’s so far on her side.
I've invested 9 goddamn years watching these twits. I'm going down with the ship.
It's a weird way of saying you don't want to see my penis
Did the same thing more than 20 years ago and I still think about it periodically. Brutal.
"And those offences are not Criminal Code offences. Criminal Code offences require it be established ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that an accused actually committed the offence."
Which is why I'm glad he turn around as he did. xD Still is both scary and funny if you look at it from a different light
"That actually sounds like it would help, I’m glad it worked for you and I hope you eye is ok now 👁💪🏻"
"You're clearly upset tho, you're not doing a good job proving your lack of caring"
Thats even worse than what you put up (no offense really). Your work is well done just a hideous design.
"I didn't hear anything, somebody sent me this."
"""Until I lost my penis in a tragic balloon knotting accident"""
That's why the other half of people call me an asshole
That is definitely an unpopular opinion. Upvoted.
Yeah it's a weird thing people do

The way colt talks in that weird calm voice is like a psychopath. I hate it. It’s so condescending and creepy.

"Not the snowbank, though. That will end badly in spring."
Lucky bastard the cool change came 5 minutes into the wedding
The bus loop was never going to entice families to transfer their kids to city schools. Is it great for kids already there? Yes.
"All they see is EA bad, this whole sub is coming full circle jerk now."
That movie really scared me when I was a kid.
Never once is it implied that the birds can sense crazy people.
Scary that [NAME] ASG effort looked similar to some of his regular season performances.
Didn't look that thick either...no snow....this was ending badly no matter what.

"Well it didn’t work that well, I mean... they lost"
"can't remember much of what happens. All I do remember is I was miserable. Good performances, but it was a bit dour for my taste."
They spam that stuff because its working. Make them stop it .. and punish them.
Let's kill and eat them all. That'll stop those damned animals from deforesting my forests

The only thing wrong with her is her face. Maybe she has a giving personality?
There just shouldn't be police enforcing nonsense traffic laws. Cops should stay at their station until summoned by a citizen like fire trucks and ambulances do.

No. [NAME] is the clear #1. But [NAME] could go first round
I don't know a ton about the history of this specific example so I can't really say.
How is [NAME] fleshed out? His entire role in ep1 was that he cooks. He's about as important as [NAME].

I'm not even going to read all of that. It is not mindboggling AT ALL. [NAME] is a huge douchebag. The end.
"While it is unfortunate to hear that he is no longer interested, I hope that this brought some level of closure to you."
I'll add to this: be prepared to not get closure or questions answered. This is the hardest lesson I had with my break up.

"But what about teams like the cavs? They are clearly a terrible terrible team, but they gotta wait longer to rebuild with a 3 year average."
So you'll bleed and be in pain twice that day.
We are up 2-0 and this game is pissing me off so much.
"First I was afraid, I was petrified..."
"I keep thinking ""this is it, Reddit has hit rock bottom,"" but they keep proving me wrong."
Hate them. I really don't need to hear about you pissing your pants in the first grade.
AV is a system where if you vote for a loser you can change your mind and 'have another go'. That's the problem.
You can't expect him to like food
Unrelated but wow I’m so proud that I can read like 70-80 percent of this because I studied Chinese for 3 years. 加油！在中国你做什么？

That’s adorable! He probably wants them all in one spot so he can make sure they’re ok and not getting lost or hurt.
"That's not correct. The ""Dallas-Fort Worth, TX-OK Combined Statistical Area"" includes Durant, as it does Athens. "
Yeah I love my friends and my own cats on drugs. They're the perfect buddies. I love being with them when I'm tripping.

Same! I don’t know how our elementary level colleagues do it. When I subbed in elementary a few times it was awful.
"From what I remember, a lot of the leafs fans had [NAME] from 8.5-9.25. I can’t recall someone saying 10+"
Mine is Woman by [NAME] 😂 I get the chills when I hear that song. Maybe it is a hymn?
"Same, I hate myself for finding the last 4 chapters... my heart is devastated."
This is awesome. Makes it feel like a community rather than just a forum.
[NAME] just got punched in the face
"Me too, but glad this creep is getting attention for his creepiness outside of r/kanye"
No if we tell and kick and scream and have a tantrum that always works.
"It's a statistically slightly worse ICR, take that as you will."
"Bro, put water in the microwave and see what happens, we're like 70% that shit"
No idea what this means but the fact that you said sweetie lets me know that you’re probably really obnoxious or just being sarcastic
Yep. In Sixth grade a boy named [NAME] just stabbed me in the stomach with a pencil.
And Meteor Man Edit: Hancock was a superhero movie too even though it was terrible.
I will! This is a great new excuse for never leaving my house
Exactly all I hear is about [NAME] and [NAME] and nothing about [NAME] it is crazy.
He made no reference to they slogan.
"I try to switch it up, too; probably the main reason for the post. Gets boring sometimes!"
Another way to do it without screaming at your teammates!
Im glad your out too! Im glad you found joy in camping =)
It doesn't matter. You can pick someone with the #1 Pick that will never be any good...
He uses it in every other post. It's not even ironic.
Unfortunately it isn’t available in my location. But thank you for trying to help me ☺️
I'm with you. Would this news surprise me? Absolutely not. But I'm not believing anything regarding this subject unless it comes from [NAME] himself
"My entire family is Buffalo fans, it's all I've heard about this week"
But but r/49ers said it was just bad luck!
"I might be a prude. ""Suck him off in the bathroom of your friend's home!"" Those don't equate"
"Checked my EBT balance yesterday. ""You will not be receiving benefits for February."". I wonder when the riots are going to start."
Because everything is like a video game to them. And in real life the PvP is unbalanced!
"Didn't even take a sip of the wine, and he still got wasted. "
"Welp , that statement is not very wrong."
"I guess I can see how someone thousands of miles away would say that, but its far from the truth."
I also love this decline in bch prices. Cheers.
Can't speak for the original commenter but probably not yours since I'd rather not be tortured for eternity for disbelief.
Hell yeah! I can't wait for the rust to break off and for people to be as excited as they were years ago.
"I’d rather not, thank you. Seeing her play that evil emperor in that Star Wars movie was quite enough."
Awesome! I just read Bad Blood and have been waiting for a documentary about it.
The amount of Islamophobic media bias is disturbing.
Sounds pretty typical from Toyota really. Been hearing the same story from too many people. Sad really because they were always the best.
I’m seeing nothing the same besides the head pose and the hair. Can’t even see her eye look because of those gigantic lashes
Sad part is there’s Flames fans that think this is true
I can understand political acrimony but the death of humor is really disappointing. Very sad indeed.
Yes it would be a poorly thought out plan... involving alcohol... never heard of one of those.
No I didn't take it that way. My apologies if my comment appeared to be taking a shot at you.
I still miss the north hills bottom dollar :(
Yes but that's largely changed in much of the US (the coasts at least). Surprised a state or two hasn't legalized it
People need to quit flagging this post. If you come to r/stlouis then you are well aware we hate the Rams and [NAME].
*pokes head in from Detroit* Hi! *waves!*
You cant.Its the idiot civilian drivers fault for probably just staying behind him like a zombie. Unless they come out with heated trailers soon.
"They played a lot worse on Saturday. Saturday was really, really bad for me."
He didn’t exactly leave on great terms with the club. It’s interesting [NAME] is not even brought up anymore regarding psg transfers
yeah i heard the therm used before but not in the same context as this one.But here it just makes me burst out laughing
Aww a homophone on top of everything else. No wonder you carry a gun. You’re a coward who’s afraid of the world.
Im surprised those ebrats who tried to steal your step daughter's board didn't complain to the mom about it.
Oh noo! You are the best dog owner :)
I friggin choked scrolling up to this
"I wouldn't ever make a broad generalization like that. Typical honkies, assuming stuff"
"If that’s true, and I’m inclined to agree, term limits are a bandaid on an open chest wound. "
I think they were just doing their job. Reporting what they saw. And yea that was the happiest I have seen [NAME]. Weird.
"""Sigh"" I thought you were better than this I thought we were over this but no you just had to do it ""Upvotes angrily"""
After he did the one year contract last year I'm not seeing him staying here with no improvement from our team.
His definition of a grown man is someone who drinks irresponsibly and then beats people up. GET OUT.
Why would you say that... Oh my [NAME] those tags!
Uh. Okay. I dont thats likely to happen. Even when people were eating babies it was not die moral reasona
Lmao what's the difference neither one is refrigerated. People are fucking stupid
You're going to have to make that simpler for my tiny brain to understand
Definitely teased you ;) I think it was punishment for lifting at 8 instead of 5 this morning Prez.

I wasn't trying to counter your whole argument by objecting to a particular bit I found particularly silly
Hey I just reposted this without reading it dont blame me for it putting boy friend
That's the main reason to play [NAME]? I hate it too.
This person shouldn't be allowed to drive ever again.
What a cringeworthy load of kak this is. Wow I have no words.
His sentences don’t contradict. You just have poor comprehension.
OHH this is what Reddit finds ridiculous about this situation.
">[NAME] I don't know why, but that gave me a good laugh. Thank you. "
"Hmm, were you trying to prove your inability to read, or just your inability to comprehend? Either way, you've effectively done so."
I didn't think I could love [NAME] any more. Is there a central repository for all of these battles
No. Being a private investigator isn't illegal.
"I'm not asthmatic and am not close to anyone who is, so I'm pretty ignorant on the matter. What all does managing asthma entail?"

"I can deal with pupper and doggo in moderation but heckin, hooman, fren all make me irrationally angry."
I feel like some people here think top mind means anything they disagree with.
I fail to see the downside of that.
there's no limit when it comes to owning dogs.. more dogs = more love
i think people who get up in a dizzy over an add that shames bullying and sexual harassment are probably special snowflakes.

My biggest problem with Yuri on Ice is that it didn't have enough episodes to show the payoff of their relationship in my opinion.
You are welcome! I am so happy it worked :))
"Her lying, narcotics addicted, pedophilic grandmother with physical ailments that cause her to be a serious lethal danger on multiple levels."
If it’s fan made they deserve an award. Or money. Something. The score is strange though
Ditto this. Happy hour after work is nice and low-commitment.
Seriously. OP needs to get their shit together.
How did this get upvoted? This is patently false.
>marry up tho Except it's more cruel for men now. The men who the said women are seeing are most certainly homeless/broke chads.
"Wow, thanks whoever did the silver❣ put a ray of sunshine into an otherwise cloudy day! "
They won’t. They’re just going to ignore it because fortnite makes them money.
From what I remember of the episode they actually kicked people out of their homes by having them condemned. Many residents didn't receive any kind of compensation.
"IMO there are quite a few jobs that are criminally underpaid, but that's just me."
assault? molest just has a connotation of someone being under the influence or without proper faculties
Why am I crying alone in my room rn
"Oh man. I feel so bad for her, but am morbidly curious at the same time. Got more pics? "
Glad I tend to post pics of my cats and not myself.

"Bet you don't even get £400, you probably only started this thread for some attention "
That may be true. I was just pointing out that the logic of an appeal to nature is fallacious
"Ohhhh, that makes sense. Cheers mate "
I mean yeah we were the best counter attacking team. That counter was so disappointing
He drinks all coffee with cream. We already know he’s not above disgusting liquids.

I never even talk to my mom and I’m 40.

"They played a lot worse on Saturday. Saturday was really, really bad for me."
"He will, I feel like it's Christmas Eve and I'm waiting for [NAME]."
I'm sorry but this sounds very much purposeful. How exactly is headbutting someone an accident?
I want to clarify that I am NOT scared. I punched the mirror because it looked at me wrong.
"I'm sorry OP, every single thing on that list is incredibly wrong. I hope you're doing well now. "
I got mine a few months ago and honestly apprehensive to wear it out to a game in fear of staining it.
I feel so bad anytime I see anyone fall on their face... I just want to make sure they are ok.
Can't tell if bad troll or just ignorant knowitall
"That was such a bad yellow, he had the height and positional advantage such a bad challenge"
...it's almost like an uber individualistic fringe political ideology does not inspire communal teamwork political action lmao.
"Sure glad I wasn't coming the other way when this twatwaffle decided to try his ""watch this sick drift, yo"" stunt."
Into [NAME] [NAME] poured her hatred her malice and will to dominate all life on earth .
It's crazy I don't get where their finding them
Nearly every malicious compliance is a petty revenge story.
Coming from [NAME] even though it’s a hypothetical question it’s still gotta feel scary
Then you're awfully worked up over people seeing the world differently
I don't care about him at all. 😤😤😤
Completely off-topic but Ok I'm Officially Intrigued by Watchmen.
Honestly it makes me sad but [NAME] does need less time:/
If you just slam on the brakes and accommodate these assholes they usually don't even realize they've done anything wrong
I was one of the best. I used to get at least 50 matches. Hair loss made me invisible all of the sudden
"So she knows of 3 languages, Wonder what they are?"
This country is an absolute shithole. Our police are no better than the filth they should be catching!

"I'm not your buddy, friend. Btw, enjoy the rumble you nice dude. "
"It was white, just had some black beads on the bodice. Thanks, that was really interesting! "
Saw plenty. That is how to be a jerk to a cat. It will enforce bad behavior.
"There has been the odd occasion without condoms. No deep penetration, but never the less. Some. I feel awful."
"As an [NAME], I expected something different."
Haha I was about to say damn she straight up eviscerated her in between bites.

Sadly that's probably the worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
"I will let my nonexistent child die, thats all right with me!"
I hate it when mom and dad fight.
I don't want [NAME] to lose her job is all. She's a rare teacher who loves her job and students once you help her out and all..
"fucking melb transport. I knew it would go to shit today because of the heat wave, and it did. the only bad thing about this city."
This sub is becoming a “Gamers rise up” parody of itself. This is ridiculous.
"That’s gonna be a no from me, [NAME]!"
FUCKING RIGHT COLIN WHITE AND OF COURSE MARK STONE
I learned that recently driving into SLC for the first time in the rain/snow. I couldn't see shit. 1/10 Was scary.
You can find something sexist or racist or disparaging of some group in just about every movie or tv show.
This man looks so much older without the cap
Wow the [NAME] replies appeared in less than ten minutes this time!
38k. Between 2 cars. Bought a new X5 and lowered his overall payment. Was tickled to death
i don’t need to see more good parents don’t treat their kids this way and bad parents will try to justify damaging behavior
I already know [NAME] sucks... He will be gone in 2 years but the shitty press that you support being like [NAME] will still be here. Congrats on supporting propaganda
I can't imagine buds being very hard to find in Hawaii
That's only bad to some people. Being racist is bad to everyone.
"Ah yes January, the worst time of the year at the gym "
Dang. That IVF story. I feel so badly for that woman oh my god

":( disappointed, i expected to give out personal therapy cats."
Literally all of them have said and done MUCH worse than anything [NAME] has.
I think they were just doing their job. Reporting what they saw. And yea that was the happiest I have seen [NAME]. Weird.
"Omg what the ever loving bloody hell did I just read?? As an artist, this was extra painful to me."
It's kind of worrying that you genuinely believe that left-wing people are actively trying to destroy their own country. Approaching USA levels of ridiculous viewpoints.
We knows mumps immunity wanes; is it possible for measles immunity to do the same thing? I'm kinda scared to try Googling it too.

"Wow Toxicity has been done thousands of times, becoming less and less original, try something new. NEXT! "
CAN IT JUST BE OPENING DAY? I’m so sick of speculation. Let’s quit the foreplay and just fuck already.
I appreciate you taking the time to at least justify your reasoning but I still very much disagree.
my parents did this to my sister who was just a tomboy because they feared she was transgender and now she is super girly and not herself anymore
It’s been over 20 years since I rode the 15. I’m still traumatized.
"Anarchist to cop: ""Stop beating people!"" Cop: ""Stop imposing your morality on me, you lifestylist!"""

"I feel bad for them now, but if they ever get good I’ll hate them like the rest. "
Yikes. She sounds like she's one bad grade away from shooting up a synagogue.
I just get sad when I see people commenting on articles and videos about him that they think he's on drugs.
The faces in that drawing are kinda horrifying
"He can have his opinion, but he doesn't have to state when *no one* asked."
The men that you grew up around sound pretty insensitive. I hope that they didn’t cloud your opinion of what a typical man is like.
"Because they enjoy their toxic umoderated cesspool, apparently. Either way i'm done trying to care."
I accidentally found it while googling things about “not wanting to be [RELIGION]” and “feeling trapped in [RELIGION]” ect.
"Yes, clearly u/backwoodmenace was repeating misinformation intentionally."
No shit. Stupidest idea having a safe place for junkies to get fucked up.
The dad is a douche and the cashier seems like he just doesnt have social skills. I really dislike the dad more than anybody.
Your 17. End of conversation. You don’t love him
I was planning on saying don’t kinkshame me since I like guys of all sizes but what the fuckkkk
Shocked basement leaking got you freakin lady
And you've never driven over the speed limit?
You just posted the same thing but made it worse.
I never said she wasn't a downgrade. But on r/political_revolution the complaint seems to be that she didn't endorse anybody in 2016.
"Yeah, that teacher was a disaster. She got fired a year later for just being an all around idiot."
I'd rather be bitter and angry than miserable.
"Gotta be honest here, these people are so crazy that I read this expecting the store to be a literal apple store that sells apples. "
this off season is dark and full of terrors
[NAME] isn't likely to get traded. Out of the 4 he's the least likely.
Leave it. You should never date someone with a scheduled time you are going to break up with them.
"Too easy. I’m selling at $18k on Jan 12, 2021 so I can be pissed at myself for not selling the top"

Anyone that actually takes the train daily can tell you that. And I do feel its getting worse.
I wish they didn’t hate [NAME] so much. Feels bad to play her.
I’m kind of scared to talk to my manager about it
gotta love the random spidey head to the left on the third shelf
Fuck pancreatic cancer. Kills so many and it barely gets any funding because all the money goes to shit like 'breast cancer awareness'.
"Oh, I think I misread it somewhere. Good news then! Hope [NAME] will use him next season. L"
So I play competitive with a group of people and being the one widow is most likely fake or just wild speculation.

[NAME]? Rape? I am shocked I tell you! SHOCKED!
"This show has completely gone downhill, can’t believe I waited a month to be disappointed smh"
Do something to challenge yourself. Maybe something you’re really afraid of
That's far from what happened and there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary of the circumstances of her death that it leaves no room for debate really.
I was worried about that too honestly
Well I'm glad I decided to go to McD's instead of doing those lines!
>CFMEU Any excuse to act like thugs and not do any work.
"I'm not very good at pressing the devils doorbell, but apparently I'm decent at licking it."
Same thing happened (to a slightly lesser degree) with [NAME] last year and it made for a lot of heartbreak that some never quite got over.
Well one of our leading candidates is [NAME] so it's not like we're killing it in our search either
Where did I say that happened? Lmao most of my friends are single for the record. Quit jumping to conclusions.

Vox lies and manipulates information to drive their agenda. Same as right wing garbage. They are not an honest media outlet.
The reduction in class size seems pretty small and insignificant.

The murder rate in Venezuela has skyrocketed under [NAME] and [NAME]. It's probably best to leave.
I moved from Chicago to Indianapolis a couple years ago. Nobody shovels their sidewalks here. Nobody. It's pure horror.
The man and dog have been spotted running past [NAME] and nobody is helping! I would help but I just had my nails done.
That last story was absolutely beautiful and sad.
"Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish."

"Stop texting him until you meet him. What if he is weird, creepy, not your type etc. "
"I'm giving you an upvote for that perfect comeback, but I'm not happy about it!"

"Yep. Lots of younger generation are obsessed with their phones and emotionally rocky tend to engage in this behavior, especially women with their whole Instagram obsessions."
That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.

Ii can't believe you just said that!
"I mean, he is a terrible president. "
Don't be a [NAME] and misuse this term. We've reserved it for a movement of women who are done with sexual harassment.
"Definitely on how they act. Although if you put deeper thought into it, calling a woman a girl is rooted in misogyny. But context matters."

"I mean, the whole point of this sub is to complain about not having a plate ..."
WHAT that's heresy - how can you get BTS and EXO mixed up 🤣 Although I would die if they collabed! Can you imagine [NAME] rapping with [NAME] 😍
Also his weird spiked haircut. I wanted spiked hair when I was like 6. I also wanted a mohawk. I'm not 6 anymore.

The Dude looks great. I always get worried when I see [NAME] play these haggard characters. But he's just that good.
"Nah, they're a fraction as immature and petulant as the politician we can't ignore that actually affects our lives."
This makes me wonder if they fixed [NAME] having a very noticeable gap between her body and legs with her new shorts.

"For an alternate anecdote, I quit playing because of the forced role QM changes, so there's that."
It hurts to snap out of that denial and face the truth your loved ones are dead... I guess.
Still waiting on [NAME] to tell me how GIFs are terrible and I can’t afford to watch anymore of them.

"Of all of the fan-favorites from each city, [NAME] being the fan-favorite confuses and annoys me most. Her headlines are becoming insufferable."
All those statistics are nonsense. There has never been “true” capitalism.
He's not the issue... They'll never see her coming at them!
It is 100% a scam. They've been copying many [NAME] with the same message.
That’s a very precious word from [NAME].

"I feel terrible but I do this too, or watch obese people doing mukbangs"
It is a racist nickname because you're literally using the man's race as a means to criticize him.

The story fits here -- arrogantly oblivious customers from a different viewpoint.
I feel bad for my kids who will never get to see [NAME] play... [NAME] on the other hand...
I saw 25yr old with 3 kids and a house. How do u think I feel. I'm over 30 and still single.
"Sir, this would not be worth watching if he left out the best part."
"I too have had this happen on XBONE. I really want to love this game, but it keeps giving me reasons to play something else."
I just came off of watching all of his movies. Dear [NAME]. I love and hate them at the same time.
"Yeah I was hoping for age 30+ stories, still interesting to hear other people’s experiences though!"
"I completely understand why some people would want to report this, I just said that I wouldn’t. You do what you think is right."
"This exact scene, as a matter of fact, haha."
Yeah I tried it the best was just 100% scale.
Kind of wierd to wield something you agree with someone on as a weapon against them
"Reminds of something beautiful [NAME] said in an interview once ""I fall in love with myself. And I want someone to share me with me."" "
Yeah [NAME] is actually really cute and nice but best boi and best girl goes to [NAME] and [NAME]. Just kidding. [NAME] all the way
what a shame that online sellers have made malls obsolete
I feel the same but I don't think it would be easy.

"THIS IS NOT DETROIT, MAN! THIS IS THE SUPERBOWL!"
Wow. That was deep. I hope you make out well move on and find true love. Be strong
Agreed. You can't count on him every night. The entire team is frustrating as hell
That's true. People feel they can't trust anything so they just chose to believe what they want to believe.
"Bro, he left his team in the middle of the game... idc what argument you have with [NAME] you still left your team."
"I usually say 8.5, cuz there's a good chunk of 9 that's really good but some REALLY bad"
My favorite way is not prepping half of what I'm supposed to
"New word for me: tetch·y /ˈteCHē/ adjective bad-tempered and irritable. ""she had always been tetchy and impatient with him"""
"Im not saying it wont be self titled, I could totally see that. What just asking how he knew it was ""fact"""

Especially in TDM naive players should just stick to one of the good players and try not to die.
"Oh, wow. Hope nothing happens to his arms on the way!"
Sorry to hear about that and hope you have moved on.
That was your saddest shortest story yet
So I said earlier that this team was boring without [NAME] lately. I take that back after the last two games.
Probably. I am surprised Reddit doesn't just purge all right leaning subs.
Glad I took the 1st half spread
It's very hard to un-brainwash someone. Damn near impossible
I’ve read your comment over and over and I’m sorry I can’t parse what you’re saying.

The Cavs didn’t even want [NAME]. They just wanted to fuck with us.

Why does [NAME] also steal [NAME] revolutionism
Oh that's a shame. I bought it for $100 but willing to go wayyyy under the original price.
The comments on this thread are what I expected and that makes me sad.
Oh. My. [NAME]. I can’t handle this
Say what? He has been playing for epsilon till now. Never seen some real accusations on him cheating. I think you should read some more.
So I should definitely give up on real life is what you are trying to say huh? :(

"Well, I **NEVER**! ""Lady, you really *should*."""
"Dear [NAME], **DON'T FUCK THIS UP** Love, Me"

Sad part is there’s Flames fans that think this is true
[NAME] would love it if we rolled over into the hypocrisy of pacifism. The only problem I have with punching [NAME] is making sure your aim is correct.

You know nothing about this guy... this is a not cool thing to say.
Actually it's quite hard to decide without a proper reason. Under what circumstances do we have to do that?
this is why she killed herself you sick freaks
Hard to expect much when he has not been involved in the offense for most of the season.

I don’t think it was a freestyle? So not really comparable?
Been off since November 29th. I would rather be working and making money. Home gets boring
He looks like [NAME] in Jackass 2 when they glued pubes to his face.
Not really. My group of friends are awesome in every way possible except they are homophobic
In my experience it was just people burning the fuck out of popcorn (possibly to cover up the stench of weed) at 2am
Kitchens use bacteria floor cleaner it would almost definitely make you sick
"Other than family, I neither remember the last time I got a compliment "

When [NAME] like “should we have an alien baby” and [NAME] looked SO happy 😂💛
He was aggrieved that people didn’t recognize him and recognized steroid users instead.

"there was some LPT about it, but i don't use those so i don't remember here it is : "
I'm actually surprised it stayed up. We already got a shitpost thread yesterday. I though the limit was one per week.
I understand that but I enjoy the silence and lonely feeling I have.
This is the day we've been waiting for! WWOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
Haha cheers for the kind words mate
"I don’t get why he hasn’t brought his insta account back, he did used to use it from time to time"

"Ok this is phrased quite extremely, but respectively not many people watch lgbt stuff, like even the lgbt people watch more non lgbt stuff than lgbt stuff"

Title: geez another douche Text: ooh well lol
I actually feel assaulted by this video.
first time all season im kind of not thrilled with [NAME] post game talk. I wish he would have addressed the PP.
Because love is a lie and there is no happiness in the world
"Interesting. Expected them to go with more established names, but glad they didn’t."
This looks like don't hug me I'm scared
Fantastic news for supply - hopefully it translates to less pressure on rents. This market desperately needs more supply and this is great news.
That's interesting I can definitely relate. I ask going to ask if people are cis too but I didn't wanna confound gender with sexuality
It seems strange to me that [NAME] is still unsigned this close to the season.
If she loves the place she’s at why leave? There’s something to be said for that. Idk your all’s financial situation tho
Imagine thinking that a rapist isn't deserving of prison. He's not even sorry.
you can't really see the shitty comments on youtube. On instagram it's much easier
Yes that would've been so much fun! You can only imagine my shock and disappointment...
[NAME] is giving y'all some weird energy. I wish [NAME] would do that

She tried playing the “I know a secret” game during the hearing. It blew up in her
I enjoy that general area. Sections 203-205 are good sections pricewide and view wise
[NAME] with the truth that reality show does not = relevance.
"Gold Coast seems like it would go well on paper, but turn up to the actual thing and seems strangely disappointing would be good to tell friends about though"
I don’t know about shatting myself but I would have been _shocked_ for sure.
"Man, this analogy is frighteningly spot on. Makes me sad for the province."
"Yeah dude, that's illegal in so many ways."
I find it unfortunate that you use gender-non-conformance as an insult.
The food you are putting in your mouth is causing obesity. Stop abusing it. A higher body weight is the cause of your increased risk of ILLNESSES
Totally. I'd be happy if they put the food directly into my hands.
"The fact that you are questioning it, makes it even more worrysome. "
it sounds like a huge pain in the ass to use compared to current systems in place though.
You're happy that survs DC when you play killer? I'd rather actually play the game. Legion mains are weird sometimes.
Topic change #4. This is getting sad.
"I CANTTTT😭😭😭. That's as bad as you said, it will get better friend. r/oldpeoplereddit."
"The table actually hit her in the back of the thighs, breaking her fall in the process. She was probably fine long-term"
Re-educated her is more like it. I feel so bad for her. Internally she must be a mess. I suspect she will change her stance again.
Sure it's okay. Very sorry for your loss. Your dad's posts kept me coming back here when I was just a lurker. Much appreciation.
Me. I really needed to see this. ☹️
"I got bad news for ya'll. I picked Chargers, Colts, Saints, and Cowboys to win. So Eagles might be winning :/ "
"I just rewatched season 5. My god, I had forgotten how horrible [NAME] is. "

Sounds like a great way to accidentally fucking kill someone who might just be passing by.
I read on a different post that he died shortly after of internal injuries.
The bitch doesnt need drag race (bc shes amazing) but im still sad.
I visited NYC 2 summers ago and I have the same exact feeling as you do. Glad you liked the city just as much as I did!
My inevitable famine is when I run out of pop tarts and get sad

I once went alert on N1 and killed 3 people.. 2 maf and a doc. Doc got resurrected later thankfully
"If you’ve never been to DSA you’d be surprised by how many amazing, smart people you’ll meet. "
I sure hope so. I wanna cry tears of joy knowing [NAME] and [NAME] rode off into the sunset with one last ring.
"Yeah it was, it was awful, everyone got sick, I was sick for like a week after that event."
"He was an awful HC, is in his 70s and has repeatedly said he doesn’t want to do it again. "
I've had sleep paralysis once and it is really bad.
Umm did you see the guy? Serious question. He looks like he gets into fights at the bar
Sweaty irritates me. But Its not exactly drag lingo. I've seen it on so many other subs too.
"Oh so it is a separate guy filming, it’s actually impressive how synced up their speeds are"

"That ruling is such a mess: it gets the *reason* correct, but the Justices were so out of touch that the entire ruling was contradictory to that. "
"I just hate the ""I don't know"" people"
This is what happens when you've gotta get the video out as fast as possible. Quality suffers.
You'd think people who have this high an opinion of themselves would be more open to taking advice on how to beat certain matchups. Enjoy being a scrub.
> No one bugs me. And yet you're scared to take your family in public because of Patriot Prayer?
Ignoring your Motte and Bailey. What makes the medical needs of America so unique?
What a douche canoe to take advantage of you like that.

"No, stop! He'll stop cranking the job machine if you insult him again!"
"I was reading up last night and it's a mixed bag. Exercise can help with the depressive episodes, but it can make the manic episodes worse."

This is absolutely the stupidest mock I've seen this year
I always do this. They get closer or just move to another lane lol
"Wow, your sister has problems. It seems like [NAME] deserves free Netflix for dealing with that"
People are assuming you’ll survive getting your leg cut off right now. Coma seems better.
"I dont like to give out my number before meeting. Maybe phrase it in terms of verbal convo.. eg phone,Skype etc"
Aw crap... Parents are my age now? Edit: What am I doing with my life?
Where’s the joke? I can’t even figure out why someone would laugh at this.
The only thing I remember about that guy was the super racist remarks he made about [NAME].

"Idk, the Teen Mom subs are bad for this too. Really bad. "
"Honestly if I didn't have this many favorite characters not yet in the game, I would probably waste my 7 votes on Merlinus."

Oh. Oh shit. It's you. Sorry you had to see this glorious trainwreck.
"I was kicked, and apparently don't care about oversharing on Reddit about it anymore"
"Hey. As long as the person I help is better off than when I first saw them, I’m happy."
"Oh sorry. To clarify, I was wondering if I should mention that I am more than willing to help her if need be."
"I loved the first one, but haven't gotten around to the second one yet. "
This might be the most NYC fit I've ever seen.

Don’t forget sports gambling. THEN we’ll be happy.
Where the fuck is that Kepner rocks person when we need them the most.
Talk about a fucking hot take. Quality shit posting from [NAME] (not you [NAME]).
Yeah probably. But the thought of [NAME] and [NAME] installing democracies instead of authoritarian dictatorships is utter nonsense.
These people are so full of hate it's disgusting and disheartening at the same time. How do you de-radicalize these people?
"Unfortunately, successful and rich people blame foreigners too :("
Just say you value the friendship too much to jeopardize it with complicated red stuff.
The sad thing is his is still glitched. Just a couple days ago I died from [NAME] lightsaber about 5 seconds after someone else killed him.
Bad news dude. You're almost 100 years past that.
"Wow that was a roasting... Deserved, but daaaaamn [NAME]"
He knew what you meant. He pretended to be confused to save face. that’s disgusting...
It’s kinda sad that this made me lol.

Got it about a month after and I'm already getting bored with it.

Again it's weed not heroin. Smoke it. Or sell it.
[NAME] a drama queen?! Surely you jest./s
Rightfully so. I had it as a child and it was the worst experience in my life. I'm also vulnerable for shingles now. Yaaay.
The right time would have been never being there in the first place
This. I saw a life pro tip a couple weeks ago about this. I cant believe how clean my kitchen has gotten.
[NAME] has broken his brain so bad he’s turning [NAME] into [NAME]

You are right.. There something to be said after banging both your mom and gf while they are on the rages.

"The best one for me is still Borderlands 2, and it’s been a fucking while. Amazing how far ahead of its time that game was."
Oh gosh that's no good! Perhaps the other options are better places to start
I'd say the guy who was going beat [NAME] face in is the worst character on the show.
The reason I play quickmatch. I wont feel the shame..
The situation never should’ve gotten to that point.
"Errr, i didn't want to risk get in trouble with the discipline master, especially since we weren't on good terms at that point in time"

"Yeah lol like I'm cool with signing/drafting DL but pls not in the first like 3 rounds lol, much less at 2."
The Netflix documentary about [NAME] absolutely sucks. Don't waste your time.
“Cracking himself up” nearly made me throw up.
I remember being three years old and feeling mortified and frustrated that my preschool teacher and classmates were freely dancing to ridiculous music.
It kinda is. It's better that special needs kids aren't hidden and their families don't feel that it is necessary or required.

"Dam tears in my eyes now, but seriously great job "
Yeah I don't think [NAME] even had to move his hands for that one. [NAME] and [NAME] also destroyed the precision QB challenge too.
No... There are many ways to prove you are [NAME]. I've heard of people that proved they are [NAME] by showing that their mother speaks Yidish.

No he’s played his first season at center then finished as the starter at right tackle for every year after.
It's not funny. Your neighbor doesn't sound very bright.
I just saw a snot nosed brat eat a croissant on the subway and got crumbs all over and the snobby rude mom left like nothing happened .
He had plenty of opportunities to play with Stamkos in TB and he never turned into a star.

We should definitely ignore it and blame it on California.
"[NAME] was the ""socialist"" freshman House Rep. I liked the most, but her recent [NAME] tweets are extremely concerning."

What the hell are you on about now? Those are some weird examples to go with your clarified opinion.
All I'm saying is there is no way I would let one solo drop my whole team with a quad 0% chance
It was done before and it was terrible
Expectations was amazing - this ain’t it
"On top of the animals listed, you can also unfortunately see foxes in Oatley Park closer to sunset."
That gives you zero right or say over what someone wears. You are wrong.
"I would pay money for [NAME] to not be my nurse. She will probably ""accudentally"" squeeze my nuts. Crazy bitch."
I fail to see how a current moderator isn't capable. Perhaps they never delegated the task is all.
TL;DR No more Superbowls for [NAME]. Get ready for another winning season that ends in disappointment.
Wowowowow!!!! I’ve been campaigning for [NAME] too!
"If he would have landed that swing, it would have decapitated that guy."
This is blatant racism and harassment of minors. These people need to be fired.

The kind you enjoy & can fully devote yourself to.
This is so bad and I really don't get that politicians or party's like ovld don't realise this. Why block actually defends this.
This team needs to tighten up in the third. Absolutely brutal.
"[NAME], learn some fucking grammar and punctuation. Maybe use some paragraphs. Just an idea."
I swear Denver has the worst sports media personalities.
"I'll kill you if you do that again, *honey*"
It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
Omfg das a lotta snow. Maybe I'll get to pull out the gas powered snow thrower for the bloody first timeof the season.
"Man, I remember when we were utter pish. Those were not happy memories."
This man just posts facts and got -220. He told them the truth and they hated him for it.
Omg I know. She honestly looks so uncomfortable. There HAS to be someone better who could host?!
"They're wrong, it was due to their natural wetland habitats being degraded & drying out. "
I always wondered why that never happened with the “muscles from Brussels” in any of his movies.
What? [NAME] looks like he’s hardly trying and completely disinterested.
I want to make friends too :( but I feel like I have nothing good to offer
I am scared that I would lose potential study time by seeing him. And worse if I end up liking him too much... :(
"Your definition of a body is whats entertaining, laughable really !"
[NAME] was attractive physically and got a match. [NAME] wasn't unattractive in his behavior and got an invitation for sex.
Buddy rocket league fair? I’m play 2 but I play like champion 1 and just get shit teammates 😡
Ok so this doesn't seem like a cover given they made a whole comp for him
I just physically *shuddered* at the idea of redoing middle school..
I suppose. It was just weird how they went on a NASCAR tangent for like 3 minutes lol.
"If your maternal grandmother is [RELIGION], so are you. Not having ceremonies doesn't change that."

I think I'm kinda the same way like I change up so much everything I say feels like a lie... See just did it again. Fuck.
Can neins bring me up to date on what this is about?
"i mean i hate these takes that because we turned the ball over 26 times, the rotations werent a problem. They clearly were"

"I was so scared, I thought the kid was going to backpedal into a street."
I had 175/1 back in March. About to go to Vegas again and it will be disappointing to only get 12/1 this time.
No problem. I'm happy to know it's not what you meant.
"Oh my, it belongs to r/comedyheaven. Laughed for a good minute"
> Good thing I know who controls the HOA. . . . the [NAME]?
[NAME] is the most useless phantom thief change my mind
Games played will hurt his chances unless he takes over the starting role later this season.
I dont own a gun. I just dont like your attitude. You read like a drugged out washed up leach.
[NAME] is decent? Dude he was drafted 3rd overall he's been a massive disappointment
And I've no monkeys left.... Sorry man
"& when you call them on their shit they ban you from their subreddit for ""oppressing people"""

Savannahs? Like 30 lb dogs in a cat skin and they look amazing to boot.
They took my favorite hair gel!! The bastards! Good thing I took a picture of it beforehand just in case
In my mind. I forgot everything :(
"i swear i've seen this on a poster somewhere at my school, it's awful"
It doesn’t surprise me given that this is the kind of establishment where staff rape the coma patients.
Hope they don't pull another [NAME] on [NAME]. Good to hear [NAME] added muscle and is healthy. Hopefully he and [NAME] can play all 16 this season
Big boobs have never made me more or less attracted to a woman.
Aaaaaand they turned it off. Terrible roads everywhere.
Oh [NAME] if I was 9 and my parents did that I would cringe real hard
So we are really going to miss the playoffs in the same season as the 10 game win streak... THEY ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE !
He has been ghosting me whenever I text or call him. I know he has been getting them though. As they are always left on read.
Your 17. End of conversation. You don’t love him
It’s been posted dozens and dozens of times since last night. People fucking suck.

I find it really strange how people align themselves with or against a politician so strongly.
"Sorry I took so long, it’s the pangolin! It’s a crazy mammal with armor scales!"
They need all the help they can get. If they continue their bad form they can get relegated. They just fired [NAME]
I REALLY love martini glasses. But not this much.
"You know what I love abou you [NAME]? Octopussy. Man, I must have seen that movie... twice."
"Oh, well, you again I tried some stuff, people ignore me anyway"
Right... so true. I’m sorry you’re going through this too.
The rape of one? Millions of women have been raped. Rape and murder is also a tool of war.
As you wish the hard path is a good one :)
Oh god. Imagine losing to Toronto in the cup final. You would spent the rest of your life hearing about it
Now that's a frozen dessert I haven't eaten in a long time.. a long time.
They just need to clean the bathroom better.
I refuse to read him any more. Just another [RELIGION] man getting a slap on the hand & a cover up job.

That is disgusting. No one should act like that to you. I'm so sorry that happened.
They need to practice intuitive feeling and depression acceptance.
i once dipped a raw hot dog in chocolate pudding when i was dared too. it was dreadful.
Don't worry... I'm on this. I'm using the non business days to cool off and figure it out. Visiting an attorney Monday morning.
Nah. I saw a post on IG this morning and screenshotted it
So wrong. Most every denomination believes they are the only ones who are doing it right and everyone else is going to rot in hell.
The very worst possible route they could have gone.
Just keep going and don't lose hope. Stuff like this can happen all the time to anybody. It's just bad luck
"This is objectively wrong, what the actual fuck lol."
"So funny, I just watched this one today and was struck by [NAME] in the height of his coked out glory. He is absolutely so gross. "
just awful I'm gonna throw a barbeque to get back at them
"An ex-friend of mine proclaimed than anyone who speaks of being raped is a horrible, unethical human being."
Solid argument. Honestly this game’s a mess and impossible to balance for both sides equally.
But then they can't draw the m word
"Your hamstering is beyond entertaining. There are tons of posts, but you can't find any?"
Argument a month. I should be so lucky.
"Wow this was an eye-opening response, and you’re right it helped us learn more, be compassionate and focus on a better well-being."

This happens in America as well. Unfortunately the news cycle isn't interested in reporting such things. Just doom and gloom.
These refs are [NAME] awful. Find a new job

This brings a smile to my face
"Which company? Tell us, they can't do shit."
Why? He was always brilliant. It was such a shame he lost out to [NAME]. Things would have been very different today...
It's kinda odd that people are downvoting you without providing well-sourced counter-arguments to the points you're making.
This doesn't belong on the competitive sub; it doesn't have anything to do with the competitive aspect of the game.

This wouldn’t feel so bad if sales and footfall weren’t but many external pressures were keeping profits down.

This thought brings me too much joy. The tantrum-throwing traitor has taken me to a very dark place.
"Apparently a 3 year extension for DACA is what's on offer. No pathway to citizenship. That's gonna be a ""fuck no"" from me, dog. "
He isn't unique to that. Every defensive metric disagrees 🤔

It sounds like that’s the bigger problem here.
The fact that you have to ask what other good games there are makes me think you don't take competitive gaming seriously in the first place...

He drinks all coffee with cream. We already know he’s not above disgusting liquids.
People’s shame and cultural oppressions regarding sexual behavior is responsible for all the world’s woes.
Or we could just get menus with pictures of food like every other rational establishment. It's so bizarre
Seeing him RT rev gave me some hope which hurts worse
Technically it’s the abdomen. Stomach and belly are just informal synonyms. That girl is a racist and an idiot.
banned from the show floor - second sentence. It’s in all the sources I’ve come across.
Ya done goofed kid. All you had to do was win.
Hitting your kids for punishment just makes them sneakier. Maybe that has something to do with the dishonesty of the church and [RELIGION] in general.
I’m concerned this story does not have a definitive conclusion
The thing to understand about [NAME] is that he's a complete moron.
He's being so unprofessional. He's out for blood for some reason.
"That’s why I called them Turd Gen, haha. Getting a High Country/Denali with the 6.2 to replace it. "

Bonus: her infamous bizarre introduction video. Truly frightening
"Yea that show was cool, unfortunately the NFL thought it was bad for the league. "
Happy Birthday!! It was great seeing her at the Royal Rumble and SmackDown.
It definitely revealed how ugly the hatred on the Left has gotten.
And you truly need to be there and see this wide spread nonchalant attitude to truly understand it how bad and rampant it is.
"Best not let [NAME] near him, what with her oils and all..."
Aww man. And I just came up with a great shitpost I mean idea....

The biggest cringe is actually all the people commenting she's a man
"That's what I say, but the commercial is clearly pandering."
"I can relate, and I blame sexual tension because of it."
"When you stop making garbage takes, I'll stop correcting them"
"It's an unfortunate situation, but it had to be done at some point."

I agree with the last statement but apparently I'm also bad at matching pokemon to rep :(
[NAME] is letting [NAME] play 3 :0. That is good news.

I tried to send this to a friend but [NAME] knocked it away.
"I was too legit. Too legit to quit. Now I’m not legit. I’m un-legit. And therefore, I must quit."
The story fits here -- arrogantly oblivious customers from a different viewpoint.
Les Collines (Never Leave You) is still a bop. I loved that song and is still awesome in 2019.

Now all we need is to beat them in the playoffs one last time and win the super bowl THEN I'll be able to be happy
I didn’t say for how long I’d been in it. :) Maybe it was made of ply board and garbage!

£20 per child?! That is ridiculous! You can’t buy much of anything for that! I am furious on your behalf!!
You don't hand your baby to perfect strangers in public. You keep them close and mitigate exposure to the best of your ability.
[NAME] had them a few months ago. Friend bought some for her sick dog.
And the apartment is clean! You can see the floor!
How is she at all mobile at that weight? Bones are incredible things!
"Let the liar lie, it's more fun to watch."
Can’t blame him! She kinda looks like [NAME] long lost older sister.
Damn! Kids these days don’t give me much hope for the future. It’s supposed to be a flaming dr pepper 🤦🏻‍♀️
It scares me that left to right is also possible for anyone

"Guys help I can’t stop playing it, my hands are in so much pain!"
And [NAME] just got laughed off the stage. How things would be different if he had won. Seriously timelines would be so different.
You forgot >Having a $1500 debt on LES due to Finance fucking up
Yep that was incredibly rude. What kind of adult sits down and decides to put that in a major magazine? Just unbelievable.
"I don't control the Lib Dems, shockingly."

If I had that I’d stop working and travel full time. I do not understand the avarice of the wealthy. It makes no fucking sense.
"Mental games. Take a (mental) shot everytime the teacher mispronounces a word,or messes up grammatically"
now I kinda wish [NAME] wasn't an imaginary cartoon character because this would actually be fun.
Oh my [NAME] do you value 'freedom' over safety?!
That's how you think hes trying to input something. Glad it was my way home.
It doesn't justify singling one guy out when the whole team played bad. Even [NAME] had a bad game.
i love it but i hate everything around it. I want to theorycraft a deck with all the cards i want without having to spend money.
Subpoena is still one of the weirdest words I’ve ever seen

"already exposed when h2k went 2-16. Sure they didn't have the best players, but going 2-16 means the coaching staff should also shoulder the blame."

I'm just glad everything came out okay.
[NAME] ignored [NAME] and I loved it
"He looked so shlubby on that show, it was like he was the [NAME] version of [NAME]."
Yeah no one is gonna do that and get reported to HR for bigotry.
Now I see why it takes me 30 minutes extra to get home if I miss an exit.

He's messing with my emotions and my fantasy hockey pool....
Man hope he recovers fast. Looked really painful
"When you feel bad, remember his comments on [NAME] throwing the shoe. He sucks."

It’s a wonder [NAME] didn’t get more duis with the amount he needed to drink
Ha ha manu plays shit football amirite guys
Then I’m sorry but this game really isn’t for you. Progression like that would ruin the base of what this game is.
You said that it is a fact that [NAME] is a rapist based on the testimony of 1 person. I merely stated the same argument based on your logic.
Because ridiculously attractive people also have self esteem issues and depression Guess what honey The world sucks for everyone There’s no escape We will all die in misery and alone
A fucking power outage during a hurricane and your car is fucked.
omg no way he totally screwed himself over there XD

">Some ~~drugs~~ people are just... Scary... Some drugs tend to bring out what's bubbling under the surface, so in that way, yeah. "
I'm so glad Mercy's have to actually try now.
I didn't think it was that bad ><
Yep happening to me all the time at my college. Fuck everything
I’m ashamed to look at how much time I spend on Reddit
"I, for one, am glad you didn’t. Happy you’re still with us "
Tee-hee. It's the same server side weirdness as in SWBF2. (This is probably my most repeated sentence in this sub.)
"""If you don't support no go zones, you are racist!"""
Ideal situation. I just don't instead why fans are writing him off. He's a beast.
This looks like an obvious joke to me. Most of you are getting baited.
This is exactly what I told him. I went the fuck off. Lol

Don’t blame [NAME] there tf is he supposed to do if our wing can’t stay in front of their man

[NAME] isn't secretly homophobic he is openly homophobic
Lmao I wonder how much effort it takes to reread 2 lines that she deemed too straining. What an era to live in...
The level of protectionism is insane. This just allows Baidu to expand its monopoly.
"Because you didn't realize MEPS was an acronym? Yeah, definitely taking anything you say to heart. Piss off depper. "
Wtf. And then we wonder why people think DnD players are a bunch of fucking creeps. Sucks that you had to bear witness to such sadness.
It’s shit. It doesn’t let you see schedule information.
> [NAME] doesn't even agree with you. What does she not agree with?
This actually made me squeal like a little girl! Thats awesome!!!! Im so happy!
This is sarcasm. Let that friend lecture you for 1 hour.

"Really? I find being left alone better than being harassed, honestly."
This was actually a very interesting article. I'd never realised how Snapchat and its filters were driving people to be so unhappy with their appearance.
That's a very long winded way to say 'i disagree'
"yes they do, and I am glad that you were able to change hers. "
At least a feed of diazies stops me shitting the bed over the idea of a man wearing a dress. Uppa fuckin erps!!!
"Yes, I've had this fear. It's even worse when you *don't* say goodbye and then it's the last time you see them."
im here for blood only whether it comes via hostage situation or police chase. a peaceful ending doesnt do it for me anymore
"Nope, real serious disease affecting real people, including the person you first replied to."
I feel this. For me since I’m using those gamethreads to let out frustration but realistically I know we need to keep patient in this re-rebuild
"Honestly, this is hilarious. Did he reply?"
"There's no need for anger, but cringe and embarrassment are called for."
This sounds like disgusting wasp propaganda. You're being paid by Big Wasp aren't you? Confess!
> This isn't where I parked my car Seriously I can't find my car.
This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don't understand science and nutrition
Doesnt have insane standards or anything. I don't see what's wrong?
"The irony is, she's probably been wishing for death for far longer."
Going through the same thing and I feel the same way. Sadness. I hope it'll pass!
"Good. The US is behaving shamefully, the least Canada can do is to try and pick up a little of the slack. "
"I’m finding lots of tribes here, thankfully. Between [NAME] and a narc mom & sister, I am extra screwed."
"Well, I don't agree, but I do appreciate having a real discussion rather than just name calling lol. Agree to disagree"
That's an extremely ignorant thing to say
Why is it impossible? Can we not manage our own education and incentivise people into the fields we need them?
"My boss makes 100 but I only make 10, shat four times today so the joke’s on them."
Tried to take first one but says invalid. Thank you anyway.
Same. Wasn't good enough. Left broken. Edit: more broken

Wow did we marry the same guy. My STBX left the state for 3 months with no contact with his child.
"yes they do, and I am glad that you were able to change hers. "
Yeah that was my bad. I was just heated after that loss and was being an ass. My b
"It's like [NAME] said. They get motivated by a bad loss, they win a game, get unmotivated, and lose badly again"
I would be so pissed if I was part of that coaching staff. That was unbelievable.
Even more so. It would only make our prison (this world) even more diabolical.
Except you haven't achieved anything. You inherited a lot of money and retired young.
Guys. Our defense is bad outside of like two guys.

Omg [NAME] he’s there because you don’t listen. You ass!
"[NAME], I believe you buddy. you might be a weird dude... but no one is weird enough to make up a story that bizarre yet banal."

I'd enjoy a nice warm hug. Along with a delightful conversation. But that works too.
"Omg lmao. Coming from [NAME] too is super embarrassing. I can't really say I feel bad for [NAME] though, he did it to himself. "

if its not for [NAME] i will combust into flames and I will die
"Actually surprised it's still going. It was fairly fun from what I remember, albeit a bit rough around the edges."

[NAME] has to have a shot. Tough son of a bitch. Also [NAME] = [NAME].
I am so happy that sub exists
[NAME] was half-blood but it wasn't a smart idea to bring up his father.

Hell is a great town. Don't you dare conflate it with those maze and blue bastards!

"Gonna warn you, that path is a lot more dangerous than you would think..."
"I will admit I see why some people could hate him, but each to their own. "
I don’t think he forgot. His weight just almost carried him off the sink...

Gorgeous. We headed to the Bob Hall pier to watch it on the beach.

"No, just dont show off your books. "
"[NAME], my eyes are hurting from how furiously they're rolling in my sockets right now."
Kinda both. The show itself is mediocre and has pretty generic jokes in my opinion. But the fans make me dislike it even more.
You credit yourself with acheivment you do not deserve. Not a first and defenitely wont be the last time.
"He did a [NAME] score? ... yup, that's how unmemorable it was"
And the healthy snacks are on their way!

I like that they have a red light camera there to combat the red light runners. You can see it flash twice at 0:48.
Literally nothing. Every single thing on my body is ugly. I'm not exaggerating or imagining things.

This isn't cringe at all. He's making a joke.
I'd be more than happy to indulge this toothache.
"You need to tell her, and make sure she knows it’s not your kid. You went through with a dna test right?"

>it should be **illegal** to teach **religion** to young children Do you believe in a separation of church in state though?
One you don't like. It keeps messing up your contacts as well.
Threatening to drive your sisters into the ocean is illegal. It's called making a terroristic threat or menacing and can cause her to lose access to your sisters
Score is currently 12-12 when 25:th round begins and [NAME] has 35-10 stats. Insane.
"Right. Because our modern society is NOT eye for an eye. If it *was* eye for an eye, the cycle would be endless. Thus the saying."
No problem here. Bio hardly ever matches the personality
Thanks for taking this on. My daughter's extended family on her father's side do nothing but indulge this crap and it's undermining everything.
Being disgusted at disgusting things is grown up.
Yelling anger sorrow. Not that funny to me.
Sorry if I’m late to the party but when does the new season start? I’m getting withdrawals! Happily ever after that is.
"Welp. That sucks. I always check left and right when crossing an intersection, getting T-boned is one of my biggest fears."

"Weird, just got back from the one on Grand 45 min ago and I got in and out no problem. "
Yup those are the two worst tasting out of my cocktail!
But doing those things makes me feel so.... icky.
"Indication of questionable parenting perhaps. Encouraging this reaction seems a bit tacky. Not respectable, if we're truthful here."
A few years ago a lot of shows tried to do a “second screen experience”. It didn’t work and died a quiet death.
"That doesn’t even look like her! Except the [NAME] in the background, now that’s the one we know and love."
"It was so ballsy. I still shake my head, thinking about how....tactless it was. "
I'm honestly so pissed off for you. That whole situation is insane. Good luck moving on. No one deserves to be treated like that.
"Yeah, I don’t like my friend’s opinion either"
drafting doesn't guarantee position or quality...AND tanking destroys free agency and devalues all the Magic assets for transactions this summer
"I just dropped out of my science class without being at school, hot damn"
I've had sleep paralysis once and it is really bad.
Sounds hella aggressive. You can say the same thing while being nicer about it.
"So, I'm wondering if there's something I can use for this project that will help you if it's solid."
Personally I think anyone false claiming Jailor and continously claiming it every night while not being mafia deserve idk like a week griefing ban or something.
Personally really enjoyed it. Have it in my top 3 AC games with AC2 and Black Flag in there too.
And dedmon is expiring. So he likely would have walked for nothing. Huge win
Consoles can’t hit 120 fps in fortnite m8. You’d be lucky for like 90

"I'm giving you an upvote for that perfect comeback, but I'm not happy about it!"
"Thank you, and same to you. I was a single AP once, it was lonely. Do you see other people?"
I don’t set an alarm I naturally wake around 4am. Love my mornings.
"Of course I have. It’s nothing, absolutely nothing like this. Its just a few much bigger pieces that break apart now."
You look like a bear.... An ugly cartoon bear
"Because they're all done by the same, really, really old guy"
I didn't read that but so what?
Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways.
Reminds me of [NAME] from the documentary THIN who purged food through a feeding tube in her stomach. This sounds dangerous.

"Imagine this spreading big time, pressuring them into opening the stadium against us so they don’t look like cowards, only for us to thrash them again"
Life as a chef= late nights with booze and strippers.. wife doesn’t approve of it but hell with her somebody’s got to suck it🤫

So the article is pretty much nonsense.
lol @ additionally “learning” physiotherapy as if we DPTs/PTs didnt spend our own 3 years learning.
I thought that type of camouflage failed horribly because the high contrast and defined shapes made the ships really stand out.
Meh. Everyone's entitled to their opinions. I won't lose any sleep knowing they think my opinion is garbage. I am at peace with it.
I don't like this gif and that makes me a [NAME] supporter? My argument has not once brought him up. You are an insidious liar.
"Not taking any shit, not being afraid to stick up for themselves or say what they’re thinking. Stomping on eggshells."

"Nah, I think it's being as dull as a butter knife."
"Not the point, and also I'm sure this means raider can dodge gb it."
"wasn't aware of that sub, and wow ... that's one crazy racist cesspool!"
"Misleading title, his administration cut all programs using fetal tissue, not HIV stuff specifically. Still sucks though."

Because I have no self-control and I hate myself.

Because his reconnaissance is not unique in any way. Literally everyone who saw that movie thought that was surprising.
Need to go middle of the road no [NAME] is going to vote for [NAME].
Sorry to hear that was all it got :/
You’re right. With IDs coming temple desk workers will look an awful lot like TSA workers.
This isn’t really new... or at least isn’t a new idea. Has it just now been shown in research?
Nah it's just weird that they wouldn't try diazepam first since it's so often used.
[NAME] pretty famous for that. I love the show but there is an entire episode that is blatant anti-nuclear energy fear mongering.

I don’t think this fits the sub
"It’s okay, my mom has always hated me and I’m fine."

I think it was a one time thing because they still go for a lot more. I got lucky.
Most of them seem to be the evangelical type who even think the pope is [NAME].
Theres the link I use you stupid fuck get the fuck off my post you fucking shill

Having met [NAME] wife (figuratively)... I reckon [NAME] is a bit of a monster...

"Considering that cheating is a mark of high-status, I'd be surprised if the wife dumped a cheating husband."

Yeah but who’s to blame when you are put into a seemingly meaningless game when all you care about is one rank. Bad system.
I was suffering a delirium flu during the phantom facemask game so it’s all sorts of suffering for me.
I can't not pick Savor the Flavor when playing Stitches though. It's just too damn fun.

I wonder if we will get to actually see the demise of their relationship. I doubt they will do it on the show though.
These stories make me glad that I have a job that doesn't require social interaction besides my boss and coworkers.
It doesn’t look like the opening is wide enough unless you turn the plate sideways. Crazy way to present food
"Well tickle me pink. Thanks for following up, I enjoyed the read."
It bothers me that he doesn’t respond to your texts. That’s weird
Be happy because I won't be short anymore one day
“The weird thing is she’s got a tattoo of our company on her back...” lmfao
That's not fickle. That's insane and delusional. It's not some cute little quirk. It's a disconnect with reality.
This is one of the best things I’ve read on Reddit Cheers to your perseverance
"I might not agree with the maduro regime, but t how can BoE justify what amounts to stealing $1.2 billion in gold from Venuzuela? "
Shame he’s an UFA instead of an RFA

omg i cant believe that nifty is still a thing
im sorry for your loss. your aunts behavior is disgusting. dont give her anything.
the worse part is you might be crazy yourself and have no idea!
I don't see how my reply was whataboutism when my point of contention is directly related to the point.
"in the words of [NAME]: As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it. Had to give you a career to destroy it "
Is that Guildford? There always seems to be plenty of zombie-like pedestrians around town!
I took a picture of a farmer treating his crops with roundup yesterday.. it was horrifying
It’s only missing a line that says “who was born in June” for absolutely no reason
Probably scared they’re gonna get flashed by a camera.
I guess I'm just too nice to people and I gotta learn to start sayin no.
Our road still hasn’t been salted on Troy Hill
Chipotleee! [NAME] Damitt! Closes in 39 Seconds.. but we made it!! Loved this guy!!
“Got caught talking about meditation” Sounds terrible I am so sorry you had to go through that kind of thought policing.
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
Dude that looks like some sh*t out of a James Bond movie!
Doesn't matter what we do. The announcers will trash the Wolves and praise the Lakers. I miss [NAME] and [NAME].
"Of course it's going backwards, people generally don't want to acknowledge men as the people that hold society on their backs."
Yes! I was lost without subtitles on Sons of Anarchy.

Oh my good lord. I just somethinged over his highlight reel.
He’s your rebound guy. Have fun. But expect little. And certainly don’t expect it to last.
"Nah, I lied. I don't judge people's kinks and I like that [NAME] always moves me."

The more you wind me up the worse it gets for her later on
It's kinda odd that people are downvoting you without providing well-sourced counter-arguments to the points you're making.
"[NAME] “ I’m afraid if I don’t have money she’ll leave me”. Yuh, you’re exactly right [NAME]."
I had a GB in 1999 and it was worse than birthing my son. I would have loved to have had the sleeve....
Gross. Don’t need that diva. Build it up from the trenches out.
I think the fan base is mostly past that at this point. Almost everyone has MASSIVE problems with some of the decisions Nintendo makes.
"Ouch, that looks horrible. Tagged his leg on the dumpster. Lucky he didn’t lose a leg going that fast."
Oh no! More non-existent performance issues to complain about!! Can't wait to be playing it while all these self-righteous gamers take their noble stands...
You really don't allow children to come forward with bullying until they have video evidence? Lmfao
"I dread the day something happens in Ireland, we've been sheltered from the most of it."
I just don't think [NAME] is the guy to do something like this.
Holy shit I didn’t realize he didn’t fumble all season that’s wild
No. I'm just against forcing your beliefs on people who aren't old enough to distinguish reality from fiction.
"Indeed! Oh [NAME], you are in for a horrible life..."
That couple were jerks. I am glad you made them move.
"[NAME] and I, we're gonna have a hell of a time!"
Don’t think there is a single person that thinks he overreacted there
"Yes, some doctors look down on military docs. However, I've never seen military nurses looked down upon. If anything, it gives them a leg up."
He most likely saw you and just didn’t care. Sadly.
"I don't drink I don't smoke I don't do drugs and yet still am not ""happy rich and all that people say this brings"""
Same but I’m not really believing the OP isn’t a troll.
His 2 point shooting has been bad this season atleast he is still staying aggressive
I TOO AM HUMAN AND I SENSE A JOKE HA YES I AGREE WITH YOIR LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION.
I am mad as hell nothing is being done on her crooked ass her and [NAME] both. LOCK HER UP. LOCK THEM UP
Lol there’s always that one guy in the comments
How dare you say that. He's a toad of the people! Not some rich frog!
That explains why this has suddenly become an issue now. I wondered why no one cared for the other thousand months ranked wasn't available on mobile.
If your walls are not connected sprinkle your lawn in between regularly with diatomaceous earth. It will kill them before they can get to you.
"you could do that but i woulndt want that as soldier, widow or mccree. but of course reaper should not try to break the shield"
no it is not the same. At the level of 3k in income then it may seem the same or trivial to bother with though.
"I don't know, but there's probably a word for it in German."
10/10 reading. I don't care if it happened this way or not. I was sufficiently entertained!
Mother of [NAME]... Im not grossed out very easily. I can stomach just about anything. But this made my fucking skin crawl....
This is awesome. I have so much junk in my head that I need to address the way you describe. Thanks for sharing.

The only sub that’s really bad now is the GKS the others are fine actually.
That fellow sure is one hell of a sweet talker!
r/iamverysmart and r/woooosh in one. That is just about how pathetic one can be.

I tried that. It doesn't work out very well. You become a machine.
"Thank you for your feedback, I was just trying to tell you my reasoning behind it sorry if I came off as angry."
"Wow. AP should find that video and flag whoever did that...deep, scary issues at play"
North Central exactly... Poor dude's name is [NAME]. Popped right back up and finished the game...
I love going out in treacherous weather. For real.
"I wouldn't volunteer a second honestly. That weather is not worth it, and neither are your coworkers."
This sub is going to be so ridiculous until he signs somewhere lol
"They are dangerous AF. I had a student faceplant and break her face, and my daughter's friend hit his head and is in a coma."
"My first name is her first name I mean, not my reddit name. "
Thanks for taking this on. My daughter's extended family on her father's side do nothing but indulge this crap and it's undermining everything.
I think [NAME] could've been a long term quality backup. We really should have hung onto him and ejected [NAME] like a bad habit.
"What about fuckboi from DR? [NAME] ex. She was frauded if anyone was. Naive, but frauded."
"As sure as gods got sandals, it sure beats fighting dudes with treasure trails"
Since when can a family member drive against other familymembers because you both own it? That would go horrible if that argument was valid! What the hell!
"Thanks...One year in making, I hope it gets the love it deserve. "
No. Can’t get off to my own sex.
Idk I sort of loved seeing rich kids get stranded on an island with nothing but retired 737s to get them home.
"I'm sorry, but that poor kitty looks miserable."
We gotta throw the whole world away
I enjoyed that [NAME] kept saying [NAME] last name wrong over and over.
"Haha yea few cars drive worse than a Versa. Aside from performance, what are some must haves/wants?"
No. It’s slower and takes more calculation but it can be done. That’s why it should be practiced.
"Yeah, this guy actually seems quite smart. (But a horrible and manipulative person)"
And you've never driven over the speed limit?
Hate to see him go. The only thing I’m complaining about besides this was the hagelin trade back in November. Both hit home
Sometimes you gotta agree with the terrible Facebook memes.
Wasn't meant to be. Que Sera Sera.
Our volume of immigration does not mean it is easy to get in. The bar is very high and there are many applicants.
Probably when they fired their cartoonist a few months ago for having the wrong opinions.
I didn't see it either! I feel like the kid at the birthday party that didn't get a piece of cake...
The longer you look the worse it gets.
But it's especially tough when its state-owned oil. A lot of Scandinavian countries had hiccups.
"Agreed. Sadly, it's not uncommon enough, and it makes me sad because of the implications about mutual respect or the lack thereof."
Ironically every /pol/ meetup is more diverse than the people pushing diversity and race mixing. Weird how that works huh
"And also, turning someone's hands into spaghetti is cruel and inhumane and not a reasonable punishment for theft."
I'm still so sad we never got to see [NAME] witnessing his miracle baby's first steps. ☹️
"I mean it makes sense, they're into [NAME] because they totally dig the horribly socially stunted types so they love [NAME] for horribly traumatizing her."
5 is absolutely average. 6 would be kinda cute but nothing special. Kinda annoys me that so many people rate 5 as being lowkey ugly lol
"She did NOT try hard, that's the problem."
"wow, there really is “somethin” for everyone ..."
I hate people who have the blinders on when it is one of their friends
[NAME] still got a little pop tho for calling for the match. Makes me smile that the crowd still loves her.
"To be fair, I’m not slaughtering my own food "
Damn these refs actually fucking hate us.
I cant wait. I'm curious if it will give us any more insight into the incident other than what we already know.
"I literally never said it costs that much a day. It was just a dumb guess. It's obviously more, mate."
You might not be eating enough. You almost have to double. 2000 calories of meat vs 2000 calories of veggies is a HUGR difference.
There is always the risk of a team throwing him a stupid offer sheet. I still wish we would've thrown a max at [NAME].
I like how the title contradicts the subreddit it’s posted on.
Right :-) The rookie was so scared to show his hand and he thought his two pairs weren’t good and thought he had lost.
What about every series prior to that? [NAME] was awful vs the bucks [NAME] was awesome. What about the years before that?
I bought the double barrel and fully upgraded it and now it's one of my favorite guns.
"Well, that’s the strangest thing I’ve heard all day, I guess I might as well delete this post then"
[NAME] is getting very unhinged I almost feel bad for him at this point
Fuuuuck. I feel this. In my core.
You need to recheck your science. A simple Google search will yield research articles showing a biological and genetic basis for being LGBT. Happy reading!
That's a pretty bad example ngl lol
Fuck man I didn’t plan on crying in my cube today
"For crying out loud, all they had to do was use the smegging wipers!"

"It's a difficult one really, because some customers would probably be offended if he said ""your husband or wife"". "
Who is your least hated and absolute worst? (Outfit based only)
Seems highly unethical for a lawyer to sign exclusive coverage contracts on their pending cases.
He’s a douche because... why? He got turned on by some animal porn? Why does that make him a douche?
"worst case of life is unfortunately apt here, eh?"
Is it because of the huge black spider above it?!? That bugs me more than it being off center...
Interesting... is it a felony in certain jurisdictions?
omg that was full on Tequila [NAME]!!!
She’s lovely! Cheers to your lives together
[NAME] is such a pretty lady. I'm jealous of those huge eyes!
>[NAME] pulls publicity drama stunt with mild success. FTFY
after that we had no sustained damage for the fight so [NAME] and [NAME] just killed [NAME]
They claim religious persecution and no lawmaker would want to deal with that can of worms.
[NAME] punches here are so desperate and have absolutely zero power in them. He was outclassed so badly twice in a row after such a dominant run.
"yeah, there's even more registered online. scary."
"There were TWO of those ""catches"" that hit the ground... ugh."
"My daughter loves this! She's taking a bath rn singing ""fiire"""
Oh dear lord. Imagine if [NAME] scores off the break from a scoring chance of [NAME] and [NAME]
well guys it was fun. [NAME] passed up the open three ffs
Most likely shock that had him so comatose.
I think a [NAME] government would be far far worse than Brexit.
What a sweet “welcome to your new home!”
just read it... how do these people get away with such garbage decisions.
Ouch. Rough year for the jags. Where upstate are you?
The general rule is that [NAME] is talking rubbish whenever he opens his mouth.
That unfortunately still doesn’t stop the thoughts or really address any issue I raised in my post. thanks for your concern though mate. I appreciate it
Same...except that I'm not good looking :
Just like the [NAME]. But nobody complaining about that.
Fucking fuck! 2 (or more) sets of fucking socks in fucking sandals.
I think they are tied together. It is very difficult to maintain desire if you cannot accept things about that person.
"> the adventure starts in the year 776 Fuck, wait, really?"
I swear Denver has the worst sports media personalities.
Hey don't insult troglodytes like that. I'm sure they would have wanted vaccines
Take this down my dude. This is cruel.
I called an ambulance for my friend without knowing it was against her wishes. She never blamed me but I felt really bad about it.
"We've been linking that dodgy-as-hell Ukrainian site for years, so go nuts."
[NAME] was not childfree. He just honored his wife's (who is childfree) desires because he loved her.
"You must be heartbroken, I’m so sorry. Can you start seeing a therapist?"
I'm sad I had to come this far down to find this.
"This post made me smile, cute doggo "
I will GLADLY tell him to his face. And have.
Not without espousing blanketed partisan political opinions that will get me a million downvotes
You guys are horrible. I love it.
It’s definitely a massive problem for both of us. Attributing blame does nothing to solve the problem.
"Not necessarily, plenty of people in my small town that will buy your food stamps."
Oh [NAME] if I was 9 and my parents did that I would cringe real hard
"What an incredibly well thought out response, totally related to the character and moves that were previously being discussed"
It sounds like that’s the bigger problem here.
It's weird because sometimes I care and sometimes I don't. Although I wouldn't call myself an asexual I could be leaning more towards demisexual.
"NOLA is a terrible place to live, ran by democrats forever and this is the result. "
It's sad that nearly everything seems ok as long as [NAME] told you to do it.
[NAME] i want to slap the shit out of her
I just physically *shuddered* at the idea of redoing middle school..
Do whatever you want if/until you have kids. Just stay safe.
> that hurts my enjoyment of society. Then what could you possibly mean by this?
"It's a dumb and harmful thing, when you invite people because of their race and sexual orientation over qualifications and skill"
I just watched this episode twice and I already miss him. Restart the series.
Is it just me or does the outro hurt your ears. The intro is a whole 12/10 but the outro just seems to hurt
"Im always worrying about the same thing, thats why Im always posting and within hours freaking out and deleting my posts "
I'm so racist and self important I refuse to braid this girls hair
This year would’ve been the year to start it... we’ll likely be losing the heart of our team after this season
"You got a reply you walnut, as the guy said, plenty people collaborated this info."
"I’d kind of be kind of shocked if Chili wants us to hit mostly ground balls, especially with how hard the shifts are nowadays. "
[NAME] some of these post i read on this sub its just getting too ridiculous
"Yes, because private matches are a thing. Surprised no one else has mentioned that one."
Possibly cool idea not well thought out
I’m happy I could help. Let me know if it works
I will be surprised if this actually has an impact. Just a few statements about the importance of the commitment to defeat ISIS and the withdrawal will continue.
Man I love this team. No I hate this team. No I love this team!
I feel sorry for him. He gotta be an awkward guy who has no friends.
It actually makes me really happy when people literally call me [NAME]. Thanks kind stranger!
"He's a selfish bastard druggie, so we no longer care about him. Thank you for your condolences <3"
Thanks for your words. I appreciate hearing from you. You bring up some very disturbing points.
You were used as a weapon to inflict pain on your father. Glad you reconnected and found a good parent.
Thank you. People always forget that The Happiest Days of Our Lives is essentially part of that song.
Is it public? Are they aware of what's going on *all the time*? It's not as cut & dry as you think.
Yeah but who’s to blame when you are put into a seemingly meaningless game when all you care about is one rank. Bad system.
Interesting. I’m not a troll.But if it makes you feel better...
TBH I was worried he actually hurt [NAME]. Glad everyone is ok.
"> Without enough predators, **due to humans displacing them** Seems the focus of this comment is i the entirely wrong area."
Wow! Dude has aged well. Maybe I need some of that snek oil!
I understand that they're meeting a demand I just don't think meeting that demand is a social good.
"Do I come across as thin-skinned? Hm, never noticed. Maybe it's an allergic reaction to dishonesty."
"I'm sorry but ""Amish heifer"" took me OUT. "
"You gotta block the name out, sweets."
Are you surprised. He doesn’t do anything with himself
I can't even be mad that you scored a goal with your face.
This is the kind of question that gets me more concerned on this sub
"Yup. I feel you. I'm very sorry it happened to you, too."
"some of these, these neighbors don't sound like the greatest people."
[NAME] gets eliminated the 3rd time she's in the bottom so this is wrong and [NAME] would have the best track record if this is true
The thing that screams narc to me is that you still had an 8pm curfew at age 20.
"I don’t love prison- I love the stuff that leads me TO prison. Get on board, [NAME]."
You'd think we don't have anymore tears already... It's been 62 years of crying.
I don’t know about the whole state but we do have some shady cab drivers here.
"Yeah, you get worried sick, imagine them hey slaughtered by Coyotes AND realize it’s all your fault."
Surprisingly all of my family keep their toasters on the work top despite being [RELIGION]/Unionist ?
Ehhh he got played so hard on the [NAME] vs [NAME] situation in 2017. Lost credibility after that for me
His head bounced on the hardwood. Damn.
Kotaku never ceases to amaze me with the horrible decisions they make in posting stories that can ruin people's lives with no confirmation or validity.
Never forget when [NAME] almost knocked [NAME] out
I’m kind of scared to talk to my manager about it
Wasnt meant to be rude at all.. more like that everything is going to be alright soon
Some dank shit DEFINITELY happened at the Ritz back in the day.
I love [NAME] comedy. I hope she makes another show.
[NAME] is a creeper and hangs out with underage girls n shit.
"It's why it would be a mistake to move away from the ""mega-thread"" format."
You didn't come here to debate. You came here to excuse abhorrent behavior.
A news source putting out sponsored news is inappropriate. Stop reading BBC i guess
I'm sorry it happened like that for you. I really can't imagine.
Same here! Although I just try to be happy whenever I am with my child.
"I'm so happy that this worked for you! Go forth, and have unashamed sex in my honour."
That must be so frustrating. Sounds like he’s digging his heels in and refusing to accept his faults.
He's practicing difficult shots too much thus loosing a feeling for easy ones.....
What GDP growth? The one that barely broke 3-4% since 1984 and has dwindled to 1-2% to 0 to negative 1%?
"Holy crap OP this is genius! I’ll be doing this from now on as this is a big problem for me, thanks!"
That's far from what happened and there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary of the circumstances of her death that it leaves no room for debate really.
Surprises me how a dude that let his keyboard get to this point even cares enough to clip his nails in the first place.
"Also, they ruined Top Gear but that’s a whole other issue."
This does not sound like a good situation for a child at all imo.
It's probably easier when they're stuck on an island
how the hell do I post a picture
They start as needy creeps and work their way up to being dangerous.
What a useless answer in this situation
wow. thank you. you dont know how badly i needed that tbh
"Oh god dammit I've been bamboozled, I fell for the b8"
hahaha. best response I've seen in a few days
"The same here. It's hard to be alone, but not as hard as the eggshells and abuse."
"Enjoy spending yours oblivious and phony, slowly realizing as time progresses how very wrong you are. "
Well if you already bought them why throw them away? Use them up and don't buy anymore.
Very sad. People like this are ruining Aus.
"Wow that's amazing, I hope my situation is as good next year. "
"We need these people on our side; arguing with them may be both thankless and fruitless, but the argument must be put to them. "
THERE ARE NO CHIPS IN THIS PICTURE.
Do your worst. The tag just describes your views. Could have been much more vicious.
Probably when they fired their cartoonist a few months ago for having the wrong opinions.
I'm so glad you weren't physically hurt
My parents just couldn't understand that pick
This... I don't think this is Ohio...
If they add the yellow boots I’ll be happy. I really like this suit
My last GF called me a pedophile too. Big word for a 12 year old.
"They’re also communist, so that puts them above their reproach"
That's a scumbag move by the prof. That exam is not at all an indicator of competence or understanding.
"Roast you? The fires of Mount Doom already did that for you, you [NAME] looking ass. "
How would you get off? HOW WOULD YOU GET OFF?!?!
I've long completed everything I can and spent all my fight money. No Kage for me
I never think someone is sincere when they say why “would I care if I’m being lied to” constantly?
This stuff is very effective tho its weird smoking the quarter of a gram gets you going
"YAAAS! Even though you're a stranger on the internet, this has made my day."
really thought he'd hit a bird for the longest time.
What a weird and slightly creepy thing to come to mind as a reaction to this video. /s Edit: apparently indicating my sarcasm was necessary here.
It was less painful than a bee sting! I felt so silly afterwards!
Very good post brother you hit the nail on the head. It is unfortunate that people downvote this post to the bottom when you explain so well.
Good old guardian refusing to accept that [NAME] is stauncly anti-EU and anti-Brussels
This one is solid. OP's joke is piss.
"I love his reaction. ""That was amazing"""
It’s endless the amount of white papers written in the last 3/4 years. Not one has been any good or any use
Why are our trolls so boring :(
I knew this was stupid when the shittastic music came on.
But I think his feelings care about the fact that he's still not tall enough to ride any of the roller coasters at Disneyland
lool ok I laughed pretty hard at this.
Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he’s only now feeling the consequences of his actions
I will! This is a great new excuse for never leaving my house
I can barely remember when it was even possible to find shit that horrible
What? The claim is 2018 best shooters. Not overall best shooters
"Yeah, however you spell it - I don’t play with them "
"This momentum control by the refs is killing us, and we're letting it"
"He ran as a [NAME] in the Senate primary and then declined the nomination. Multiple times. He isn't ""honoring"" shit."
I just went to post this but you beat me to it lol
"I’M NOT ALLOWED TO EAT THE SKIN, DEE! I’M NOT ALLOWEDDDDD!"
I destroyed about 1/2 of them because black snakes are actually a good thing to have around. I just didn't want too many of them.
You're right but ”just be confident” (I know that you didn't say it ) is really hard when you're unattractive
If I have to watch Canada lose in a shootout I'm gonna lose it
It's not unique and its decidedly worse.
Interesting to see the bulk of people in that thread are pretty anti-[RELIGION].
I wish I could say the same. This is where I come to confront white supremacists. r/CompleteAnarchy and r/ChapoTrapHouse too.
Wow Donkey must be smaller than I remember
I don't really understand what you mean 😩 haha Can you explain please?
She is using you for money. You already lost her
"Well that didn't take long, sorry for your loss :("
>[NAME] has urged [NAME] and the Liberal Party to allow cities to ban handguns. What a goof.
It surprises me that he's a mod some days...
"A lawyer is not going to disclose anything to random users, you guys are delusional"
"I always loved Sunday’s because it was Extreme Homemaker, Desperate Housewives, and then Grey’s Anatomy. "
It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!
Any normal draft game is more serious than a silver or gold game. Atleast thats what I see.
"Damn some of these are so cringy that i almost downvote them, but realize that they are suppose to be terrible."
"Is pleading the 5th even legal? I mean, people should be forced to defend themselves even from erroneous claims."
"Not me personally, but I do think it's an excellent idea. You never know when a stomach bug might hit."
"hMMM [NAME] is actually my worst hero in the game. I’ll work on him, though"
Ya. It's not what you think to start. Awesome show ending within 5 seasons with a planned ending. It's refreshingly hilarious. Netflix available.
I got an instant win. One free chicken strip. 😂🙄
It’s a party and we’re all invited
Lmao good luck tryna convince anyone you’re not just a brain washed redpiller tryna start shit just for validation :/
What's there to disagree on..... it's pretty apparent
Then how can you say the rest is very red outside of nova when that is blatantly not true?
The fuck?! You're in the wrong subreddit with this regressive bullshit victim blaming.
That is disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
I have even gotten to have sex with women who were fellow comics nerds and also hated what movies have done to [NAME] stories!
"Right? That's news to me. I'll be excited when that happens, I wonder how that works."
"I already told you, food poisoning or allergic foods. The real greedy snake oil salesmen are big pharma."
Oh god [NAME] has a fucking gun oh fuck
"Yes, this is karma farming and it is disgusting to do that, BUT the title *could* be correct. It probably is made up though. "

fellow trans guy with an nmom. i know what youre going through. it absolutely sucks. im sorry man. my PMs are open.
Good news though. Yesterday the devs were running test server during the morning.
I’m guessing you’re talking about when I burned my arm. 2nd degree and luckily no scaring
I worked at a hospital in northern NJ and float pool was only $4 extra
That's what this seems to be saying unless something was lost in translation
Great fucking game for [NAME]. And I can't believe some people are trying to hate on him for one TOV in the 4th. This fan base smh
This march is spreading complete lies then as there are no rights a man has that a women doesn’t.

Not sure why you got downvoted so hard when everybody above is saying the same thing.

Like all mavs fans... [NAME] its not a rookie anymore xD
"Def not nypd lmao, but u hear you "
8 His morality is depraved. 9 His brutality is indulgent. 10 His religion is repudiated. 11 His existence is nullified. 12 His believers are mistaken.

You told me it was pointless to point it out. You're the idiot
Went on a trip to the Austin area. This park is nice if you haven’t been there. Subscribe if you can. Enjoy
I don't think any [RELIGION] woman would care about such a thing. If they did then they have their own problems.

Yelling anger sorrow. Not that funny to me.

Dallas should feel absolutely horrible this is a 1 goal game given how patheticallly bad the Devils are tonight.
"What ""same thing""? You're not addressing any of my actual argument and have barely been doing so for a while."
That was intentional as fuck. I don’t know how anyone could argue that after that insane contortionist layup over [NAME] last week.
It was a stroller so no real harm done. Thanks for asking x
They just shot up a mall. They’re complete fucking idiots.
Fair enough. That is a form of cuckery I cant approve of.
Yup this game just gets worse and worse
Still an ad hominem and not a legitimate argument or counterpoint :)
We had a long debate about how old Jackie bird is and as per every year were surprised by the result. Was pish
You also can’t prove it happened so logically this doesn’t exist and is a paradox that never happened therefore pi = 3.14159
My kitten just got very happy when Pasta scored. Such loud purrs! I was happy too.
[NAME] has towed the line of the Dark Side. He wouldn't cross it by doing something like this.
Did either of those places declare independence out of the blue? No.
[NAME] damn it I'm so tired of seeing Instagram between fights
"Don’t rush it .... it will eventually all fall into place, Enjoy today "

No! They’re still on the sidewalk right there! With literally absolutely no way around them!
"Wasn't getting anywhere to begin with, might as well have some toxic fun with it."
Well it very well could be your drug usage. You could be depressed also. So stop doing drugs and see a therapist.
Feels like hitreg in general is pretty poor lately.
"Yes indeed, the “just a joke, bro” ship sailed long ago. "
This just makes me feel inferior at this point.
Just saw your edit. What the crap. Guy was obviously creepy.
Hot take: [NAME] sucked after he went away to anger management and he suddenly changed into a moron who was completely incapable of doing anything even remotely correct.
"I'd say the bigger potential problem is getting reported for public indecency, that goes on your criminal record."
No it's not. It's two people legally allowed to kiss kissing. Whatever stigma you have is yours and not shared by everyone.
The best thing about a traffic jam on 59 is getting out of it

Good that corporate knows about it. They'll launch a LP investigation and fuck the idiots doing this.
That helps. I would've never guessed you'd style mannequins.
Probably people being inappropriate and making light that police officers are number 14 on the list of most dangerous jobs in the
Violence only begets violence. We'll wind up with an authoritarian despot as ruler if there's a violent revolution.
I’m sorry if you’re comparing institutionalized slavery where you can murder thousands to community service you’re an asshat
Oh [NAME] please don’t put them in a team together.
one quick glance at your comment history negates any value in this comment
As comic book guy from Simpson’s would say. WORST. WRITTEN CRIMELORD. EVER....
Wonder if the balls are deflated... that worked well against the colts last time.
"In the 50s my aunt was 6 weeks old when a flu virus caused inflammation of the heart and she died. So there's that, too."

this has happened to me twice...most embarrassing shit
Slathered in blue cheese. [NAME] is so jealous.
I grew up in the upper peninsula of Michigan so I love the ShopKo reference because those stores are usually in places with depressed economies.

These were the naughty children! HO HO HO!
"Exactly, humans are selfish. That was kinda my point, my reasons are superficial and only affect me. Theirs are not. "
All the plans I have seen proposed were over 5 years. This is a crazy one time jump.
I wonder if that was the original plan or if [NAME] just realized what [NAME] talked about and threw in that note to explain it.
Whoa you are on a big brain level!!
"Honestly many of these games that they lost they didn’t even play poorly, to me they looked pretty good and just unfortunately lost the game "

Just another example of why corporate business structures are inherently unethical and are a plague upon all work environments.
No it takes at least 14 days and if she’s had her period it’s very unlikely she was pregnant before NYE
We have reached the stage where below 2 million is good. There truly is no bottom to this pit.
Have to agree. The government welfare and biased divorce courts which are enforced by the state are to blame.

Which is why the floor ruling was incorrect if it happened as he says.
"I should have said without nuts in hindsight, but this woman was ready to kill. Gotta love hospitality sometimes."
I picked up smoking again thinking it would aid that void that is working. It just made it worse.

I don’t remember [NAME] saying that tbh
That last story was absolutely beautiful and sad.
One of the scariest things about being in a cult is that you don't realize you're in a cult.

Watching [NAME] cry made me cry. That dude worked his ass off his entire career for that moment. So well deserved.
Constantly worrying about her and not feeling pleasure without her presence could be. You need to talk to a therapist.
I absolutely hate the guy. Can't stand him. But we live in country with laws and he broke none. I think lynch mobs are more gross

Start acting mature. Don't get into fights with security guards about how you look.
And they sneak the bit about reckless driving and speeding in at the end as making one a prohibited person. This is absurd.

Most countries function as a faux democracy I think. Especially in the USA whereby Congress takes lobbyists money it becomes more of an oligarchy

And if you ever make a fat cop joke on reddit then you're the worst criminal of all!
I cannot imagine being so fragile that being able to smile threatens your identity and world view.

You should like a troll. Not saying you are.
OMG if the [NAME] and [NAME] run... I'll have the worst of time deciding who to vote for!

Really sad how often people don't go into the closest lane first and then change lanes when safe to do so.
It didnt fuck up his career at all. Hes got thousands of ravenous fangirls and still makes absolute bank.

I was JUST thinking about how much I enjoyed Swalla la laaaa last night too!

So every interaction with a dumb or crazy person is news?
Never thought I’d see a comrade here
[NAME] was a pleasant surprise. It might be something you'll enjoy.

So this is how democracy dies... With thunderous upvotes.
A majority of the season they’ve been able to win out in ugly games. I just think that warriors loss left a bit of a scar

Before we start obvi. I’m taking out legs before I get embarrassed.
Bro. We’ve been cursed since way before that.
"[NAME] fucking [NAME], that man is enormous."

My favorite joke of all time - whenever someone says 'My head hurts' you say 'it'll get better with practice'.
That is one of the things I’m most excited for in S2. Seeing him playing [NAME] and go off like this so effortlessly is amazing
"If she is sorry at all. Could be more along the lines of ""I am pretending to be sorry so I don't get fired."""

Thats awful and Im sorry for your friend. I whole heartedly agree. Its getting out of hand.
"Oh sorry, I forgot there isn’t any paperwork involved in getting a gun."
There are too many factors at play to really say that. It's still probably disappointing.
oh right that was a huge leap my bad
That isn't really trolling to me. Sounds like a good way to get DUIs. And stop them I suppose.
"That’s not populism, that’s demagoguery. Subtle, but big difference. "
My favorite [NAME] post-match celebration hands down.
excuse me what the *fuck* was that

"I mean, Introverted Intuition is a perceiving function and INTJs lead with it, so yeah."
Is this from “Please Like Me”? I loved that show. The last season had me in tears though. Really hard to watch. 😢
Players need to have Agency over their characters. you did not. total crap. :(
Seeing happy people isn't motivating because it shows how easy it is and how I'm failing at something literally everyone else on the planet can do
Imagine being upset over who someone loves.
Learning to read was the worst mistake of my life
Slightly too pissed off with this comment to merely downvote. Not angry enough to begin tirade. Lunchbreak ruined.

Wow! You are lucky to have survived!

Lots of words and said nothing. Cheers.
Sorry. This happens to too many good people.

This comment killed me. RIP in pieces.
"Nah, I think it's being as dull as a butter knife."
We saw them last year from Baker Beach. So many whales!
Don’t worry about the baby but yes worry about your mom...
She... Replied to a guy in a screenshot... That's just pure stupidity.
We can’t stand for this any longer!
"if he ended up with that chef, damn that will break my heart for sure."
This was actually good until the bird came in.

Sloths are cute! Especially when they’re covered in moss
Your girlfriend is cruel and emotionally manipulative. Get the hell out and don’t let anyone else treat you like a dirty little secret again.
[NAME]. I’m not sure you’ll feel the same way when it hurts to open doors when you’re 35.
Nah man. This website smells like toast and makes my left arm hurt.
"Haha thanks, I'm not cool at all but that comment made my day! Genuinely made me smile. <3"
"It's pretty stupid honestly. [NAME] clearly pointed a bug and people are saying ""oh, it's a feature"". ...seriously now."
I have even gotten to have sex with women who were fellow comics nerds and also hated what movies have done to [NAME] stories!
I don’t think that can happen here.
Mama [NAME] is not gonna be happy
But it seems like im only meeting pros but im silver 6
"Not loving what I'm seeing so far, let's hope we can tighten it up."
I found all mutual nut destruction games to be ridiculous and I never played them. My friends all loved them though.
"I'm crying right now, I don't know why. Doesn't even make me feel anything. "
It's not an conscious choice to be uncomfortable about something.
I don't think I'd like that either.
Next you're gonna tell me they didn't invent iron! The fuck?
"Some fragile egos seem very upset at the ad. womp, womp."
What the actual heck.... Like I just don't....I cannot
I could've done without the bottom right pic.
"Yeah, because it’s soooo arduous to look at someone’s profile for five seconds. "
If it’s weed I’m going to be disappointed. Can’t we all just go to the store and get it?
spurs getting carried away now. Fouling their own players.

"I enjoyed hardcore mode much, much more than regular mode in BF4. More realistic"
Nothing wrong with pasta or bread. Stop buying bleached flour products and get whole grain.
Look at the spine on that kid - he must get it from his mother!
It is amazing how social media is allowing maniacs to congregate. Social media is very bad for us.
"Other than the jerseys, optic merch is like an after thought. Wish they would step it up more."
"Unless you are actually [NAME], this is just douchy... actually, it’s douchy either way."
So your dad abused you because of your mum and you still keep in contact with him
Yes. I got accused of being a man or a bootlicker because I was a mod in a men's lib sub two years ago.
"I'd be terrible at this, I eat so slow."
So much blasphemy... This place is not even [RELIGION]. You literally deny scripture to fit a Reddit agenda.
Okay that doesn’t belong here. I thought you were going to spin the Schlenk connection
"He once played the cop too but failed- **his only failed attempt.** *[NAME] a bitch, mayorape-boy!*"
I’m pregnant and my dog is with my parents across the country while we renovate. The feels were too much 😭
Don’t say that to a person with a rapidly deteriorating health condition
"Call me cynical, but I wish things wouldn't go back. That's why I like Infinity Wars as much as I did."
Well said. Glad to see that there are still open minded people left in this sub.

I think it's ridiculous that we continue to pay taxes to fund paychecks that federal workers aren't receiving.
"Not to be critical, but “rethuglican” is an awful one "
"Hmm, were you trying to prove your inability to read, or just your inability to comprehend? Either way, you've effectively done so."
[NAME] doesn't seem to have based this on anything. The owner of the nightclub says there was no altercation at
The fact that entities go around violating rights is not an argument that we should keep them.
Exactly. How that woman has survived two no confidence votes amazes me.
Enjoy :) You won't regret it. The first couple seasons will be a little confusing but wiki helped me understand this show a lot!
[NAME] goes to insults when you have nothing smart to say. goodbye
These disgusting old hags are literally old school flesh-consuming ghouls. Like [NAME] or [NAME].
This must be what blasphemy laws felt like in the Middle Ages.
Super low and loose. Get yo life.
Mmmm traveling for work often isn't exactly the most desirable situation. It can be exhausting.
"Don't debate is probably the worst advice one can give. It's like saying: ""obey blindly. Don't question us."""

When I think about [NAME] and [NAME] at the same time I get a fucking aneurysm from the stupidity.
"What's he whining about, I am only 52 and stuck on SSI now and only getting 1400.00"
Got to love all the fake fans that know nothing about hockey!

Oi us cancers don’t want him either! We respectfully pass his birthday to April
"Oh I get it, you are illiterate on purpose because you fear to be fed with lies (in your mind). Sorry for you."
I only recently learned that! I took a class on human sexuality and we actually had an entire lecture on pedophiles.
Seriously. [NAME] is a hero. I heard he was a volunteer firefighter during 9/11.
You're not going to drastically improve in a day to where itll have any significance in a game hours from the postb
I wonder what goes through [NAME] head when he decides to shoot for 3 😅
I would literally rather have the government throw $3k into a shredder than fund this shithead’s trip down south
I had to put Bird Box because it's the only direct to streaming movie I saw. I feel dirty.
It's pretty obvious why they're filming dipshit

"I wonder if we need to find a way, as a people, to not be so dependent on the government. "
"Not really, more of a toxic poverty problem. Women get overworked too."
This is very accurately funny and sad. 🤦🏻‍♂️
I live in America and wish I could support them but they're on the wrong coast.
It’s really hard to watch for some people because of how awkward and... just how stupid [NAME] is in this episode
I quit soda about a month ago and this makes me want to go buy an entire 2-liter just to comfort myself
If Ww3 breaks out in northern Asia as people expect. It will make things worse for you guys in the states - not better
If you use one of those two I automatically hate you
Shes awful and its all about her. Try again. And when the show has awful ratings thatll be confirmed.

"I'd bet that this falls under spamming and therefor I'll get banned soon :/ (please dont, I love this sub)"

Soooo.... He basically just admitted he didn’t get his kid shit for Christmas. What a fucking asshole!
Glad to hear it. Love Rapid City.
"Don't let loneliness get in the way of growth. Grow my man, grow!"

"Funny enough, I'm a Braves fan from CT whose main football team is the saints... So I don't like this post one bit. "
Worst case scenario here is he dodged a psychopathic bullet.
This guy doesn’t know how to life...
I feel like the world just doesn’t want [NAME] to have the spotlight. This is torture for a [NAME] fan like me. :’(
This isn't a meme its a cry for help
She might just be bitter over her own relationship and this is a painful reminder in some way.
Those things still haunt my dreams to this day.
"Glad you didn't add some awful ""Read that again."" in the description like I see other people doing when they retell this joke."
I am very happy with play music. please tell me this is a lie
I didnt have a single black teacher in my 15 years of schooling. The area defenintly plays a part in that but it's still a bit shocking.
Same here. The ones who know me and my obsession always let me know and it makes me happy.
People who live in glass houses...... [NAME]. This punk has no right to smack.
"I love it, I understand they can't just get rid of [NAME] for her, but I would be so angry watching [NAME] boss her around."

[NAME] is bad & anyone who still supports him should feel bad for it.
"Boosting is when someone else is the biggest ad-hominem yet, because it was in a situation like this."
he ded.... and why the fuck these POSs have cellphones in prison.

Right?? It makes no sense she’s horrible
Pretty and sweet? BURN HER ALIVE!! Nothing can detract from their beliefs!
>[NAME] has urged [NAME] and the Liberal Party to allow cities to ban handguns. What a goof.
Don’t think this is the right reddit buddy....
You can't just make bold claims like that and provide no evidence.
"😀ahhh I see what you did there, clever."
Very sad. It’s the child I feel for most.
Exactly. And they parade around with their protruding stomachs as if they're [NAME] gift to the world. *barf*
Fuck Liberty Counsel. They are a hate group.
"Hi, [NAME]! I thought I would stop by and wish you a wonderful and prosperous year! Have a good one! -HappyFriendlyBot"
"Yes, ~~jack~~ jake will be great too! Love the audio mixer with the old Spiderman soundtracks...looks very well produced..."
The fucking worst game in the world.
I love it! It’s strangely charming lol!!! Especially when she comes back to camera speaking normally.
I know. Idk what to say after they say they already have one. I say oh good! And then it's awkward
So I uh just checked it out and my sanity is gone
Sorry you’re not allowed to be a Vikings fan anymore then

"Photo critique? It's quite blurry. But the colours is great, as is the angle. "
[NAME] aren’t a race either. Are you trying to be ignorant?
It continually amazes me how many people don't understand this.
This is my favorite game of all time. Thanks for bringing back some good memories!
I am [NAME] total lack of suprise
Yeah that's not almost a semi auto. And the slam fire is vastly over rated.
You dont need elected officials to have power when you have the people on your side.
I changed from [NAME] to [NAME] last night because I panicked. I am very pleased with my decision.
If I wanted to vote I would vote Labour. Some Conservative MPs are in the wrong party.
"Yeah, it's pretty funny how incapable most of them are of actual satire and subtlety."
"Man'. The point became invalid once the school yard name calling came out. And, 'this year'. It's only January."
Talking about scary foreign people spreading disease is a classic xenophobic trope. Vile.
Oh that’s so sad that she thinks anyone cares about her opinion
I wouldn’t recommend expensive brands in this subreddit. People get irrationally angry and condescending.
[NAME] is phenomenal. It’ll be a sad day once he’s gone
And he’s also a military veteran with a troubled past who’s now part of a religious cult 🤔
"Text to speech is a very very bad idea. You do not want to give 4,000 people full control over what gets said out loud on a stream. "
That gives me flashbacks to when my mom used to record me crying because she thought it was funny. Ugh.

He is warped by porn. He's got a problem
"Man, and I thought the princess and the toad was an odd story"

That's not true. There are people that genuinely want to cause harm to people and don't care about reactions.
"Debunked as in proven wrong. Again, he is a well known fool. Do yourself a favor and never take anything he says remotely seriously. "
"Just remember we’re all silly looking, gangly monkey things living on a rock floating through nothing, all trying to be cool. Have fun"
"> even if I despise its many subcultural, life stylist, and mobbish factions I am not sure what this means"
That’s just cruel and unusual. Hook him up for aggravated assault on a police officer.
No they shouldn't. Mental illness is a serious thing and we shouldn't encourage crazy people but instead help them
I really don’t think that was racist honestly. He literally told you everyone matters regardless of color..?

You can pull yourself out of it. Fight those urges.
We created these beasts unfortunately. I don't feel right blaming the [NAME] for this one.
These honestly are getting infuriating. The creator of this made this whole thing up yet Facebook old people take it as reality.
[NAME] gave me depression because had I been left unchecked I would have bested him in hand to hand combat by age 16
Glad I took the 1st half spread

"If you don't like it, you didn't have to comment. Just let people be happy."
[NAME] winning a ball would be...... surprising
Being a complete idiot and blocking a road in front of a bar. Which is where most cops tend to hang out trolling for DUIs at 2 am.
he looks pretty average to me. like many guys i've seen on the train.
"This is the sweetest thing ever, im gonna steal it and use it on my fiance"
Think this is the first time I’ve ever disagreed with [NAME]. [NAME] at SF WCJ at PF sounds horrible
I feel a little sad for her. That she thinks the only options or something to do is having kids. Fuck her tho.
"Wait, I see the problem, you are changing the word observation to assumption, which I think you know is disingenuous."
It is so refreshing to have [NAME] gone.
"Glad you enjoyed man, yeah it was pretty spontaneous too, I was praying I wasnt about to pull some bartard move and get jammed lol."
I remember writing on them was horrible. Slight delay which threw me off combined with the letters ending up looking like crap. Whiteboard was so much easier.
Running. That’s all. And then I hurt a major tendon.
"i had a weird feeling colts were gunna win the SB, should have put some money on it "
You have no responsibility to your ex’s feelings. Do what makes you happy.
"[NAME], beer me the strength to make this price lower!"
Someone tell me why they are out passing us they taking the game to us when we should be controlling the tempo of the ball to keep the lead.
It was never implied as such. You simply mistakenly interpreted it that way.
Or just get the fuck out and never look back.
doesn’t help for me unfortunately. i think if anything when i’m on BC is when i experience these symptoms
I dunno if that's really a HMB moment but funny nonetheless.

No it’s a lie because he could not possibly have been in Vietnam. And he did not correct a single outlet who said he was.
"Yah, I'm a bad girl. In fact I'm bad at everything."
Was getting ready to comment about this one. Was really surprised how much I liked it but can see why it’s not for everyone
>[NAME] One of the most horrifying stories I've ever heard of: the mom should be in psychiatric care and the doctor thrown in jail IMO.
I hate those days man... So triggering
Problem is that most of the female posters here either do it for attention or almost immediately ghost because they come to their senses.
Why do we even try to have nice things T_T
Looks like Big trouble in Little China
>[NAME] >not [NAME] It's as if you're asking to lose
You can't freely make a decision when your opinions are a shitty contract or life on the streets. That is not freedom.
My only regret will be posting this on my alt account.

"He's alright, Avatar, The Happening and After Earth were genuinely terrible films. "
I’m so sorry for your loss. It’s the smallest things that take up the biggest part of our hearts.
I'm sorry OP but this is all on you. Your parents played you like a $4000 fiddle.
An angry old person yelling at a retail worker will never listen to reason.
"I think that’s best, but it tough while living together and trying to keep a smile on for the kids. "
I cannot believe the fucking audacity of him. Have some shame for [NAME] sake.
"Block me,report me, do what you gotta do, you don't own reddit."

I feel for the dad curled up at the end of the bed like a loyal dog
"I'm saying put up or shut up. If you can't back up your point with evidence, your opinion is worthless. "
It's piss but its [NAME] piss so you make your move.
This offense is just painful to watch.
Its a funny joke but it's delivered horribly
Incorrect. I'll go with what [NAME] tells me thanks.
Hang on so Im not allowed to stroke your dog? Thats sad.
Wonder how that brother or cousin excuse works when Lus have no brothers or male cousins

"This is so crazy pessimistic. A generic [NAME] will win with plenty of room to spare, the problem is that ""generic"" candidates don't exist"
I put [NAME] on over the holidays...my family hated it. Freaking love his stand up though and he's pretty widely liked. My family is weird.

"C'mon Mr [NAME], you're not going to eat all that watermelon."
This is garbage. No. My garbage has more compositional worth than this. Hipster pepto bismol vomit looking trash.
Dude I have a verrrrry strong feeling the barber did that on purpose. Nowhere in the world is that an acceptable haircut. That’s fucked up
"Fuck this team. I’m done, we all should boycott this bullshit"
My barber was thinning my Hair with a new blade and cut my ear. Bled like crazy.
I'm so broke that I'd take if you're still looking. I'm a guy though.
Ok this New England accent not so fun!!
Oh. Much less exciting than the edit. We live inside the fungus.
I wouldn't announce that they are LuLaRoe.

What a cuck! But the sword and steal the groceries!
"No, it would not. How the hell is that evidence that [NAME] didn't commit the crime?"
"[NAME] is a terrible writer, a raging narcissist, and not an actual friend to anyone. "
not defending [NAME] - just pointing out *one* of the reasons folks may disagree with slapping the socialist label on anyone left of neolib scum
Its probably just related to something she is dealing with. Stress/anxiety often causes nightmares. But there are plenty of potential
"Oh man, I didn't know that. No wonder he has no care for it. Does he have any post secondary education?"

You gotta watch with subtitles IMO. The dubbed English version looks and sounds ridiculous.
They used the most terrible M form as well. Easily confused with an arc...
I try my damndest. Hard to be sad these days when I got this guy with me
21 million went to [NAME] throughout his tenure…ridiculous
The problem is not getting new players but keeping the current ones.
Ahaha alright. Im done. Peace man good luck with everything :)
We aren't a bunch of Republican puppets like you believe.
That is the most bizarre story. I can’t tell if it’s a joke.
Being approached isn't a license to act a racist fool yourself
Well that made me want to continue to live in Alberta.
[NAME] looks so defeated every time [NAME] posts him up

I’ve been abused enough by the Knicks today.
"The history of horrible things the federal government has done is well documented. The same way the federal government does it, with income taxes."
Tbh bastion is still super op before it now I can just abuse him more
If you want a one minute story told in half an hour then ask [NAME] to tell it.
Dumb people. Poor person. The wolf was the only one who wanted to help!
Weird. He's like the one capitalist in this sub that I feel I've had substantive conversations with.
"That’s what the auto-shut off is, that thing that I said malfunctioned due to the extreme cold."

"She doesn't sound like a good girlfriend then, assuming you've done nothing to warrant such jealousy."
This is what happens when you don't give the pyramid scheme a script.
I feel horrible for the government workers caught in the middle of this. I hope it ends soon.
It's an underrated drama which just got snubbed on [NAME]
After five years she realizes that's not for her? No offense but thats a long time to do so.
What I find disgusting is thinking you can be a liberal and a ecologist. Anyone has its own ideas I guess.
I hate when people down vote to hell when someone has a different (yet valid) opinion
That's not true. There are people that genuinely want to cause harm to people and don't care about reactions.
Wow! Never thought of it this way but that's a REALLY good point.
"Fam, I didn't have him kill [NAME] so I can do it next episode"
"At this point, LSC only exists to give socialists a bad name."
Lmao my jaw dropped when she started talking about that stuff with her friend
"You have too many knives, I don't trust you. Sociopath."
Ya i hate to talk bad about don’t but they should get the sticks out of their butts and make smarter decisions for their community
I enjoy fixing problems. I think of it as a task that I can achieve. People get to overworked when they set too unreachable goals.
"As a lifelong single person, [NAME] offends me. Feels like I'm apart of some demographic that they can live without :("
why did i expect this to be anything other than what it is
If I went to a party and they had SFV I would cry of happiness.

Me thinks you’re responding to the wrong dude. My original comment couldn’t have beeen more drenched in irony.
"Bro we got destroyed last time, we’re due for a heartbreaking missed field goal or extremely ill-timed turnover "
FINISH ON HER!! Seems way more appropriate for a sex doll
Ugh [NAME]. She reps a lot of people from the Bachelor
"Im at the game,somebody please put me out of my misery "
My ex asked me to tell her my steam password..... With more than 6000€ worth of stuff on it. No thanks.
Oh interesting. I must have got in a while ago.
Wrong. You tried to use a WW2 example and it backfired on you.
Stedying not cool job... we will pley and swegsters i am a vary gud bad boy

I never used an escalator until I was about 16 and I still remember moving stairs scaring the hell out of me
"I played that one. It was really fun(at least to me, as a kid)."
I'm always down for pimple popping pupper pictures!
We might now be almost maybe nearly ready to potentially maybe play finals. I think [NAME] will make the finals this year. They'll be the surprise team.
Damn why you gotta do my man [NAME] like that?
Until he leaves for the Lakers and we’re right back in the same spot in two years after not winning shit
Super [NAME] told me [NAME] was crap though and that [NAME] was far better :(

180 is not good for checking enzyme deficiency which is what I am referring too.
"Ngl, I'll probably use the argument you made here with my, ugh, Republican friends once we get closer to the elections."
I just heal and when we start to do bad day its my fault taking blame off of our flanks and frontlines
"Nothing makes me exit a video faster ""looking at this made my nipples hard"" 🙄"
[NAME] is completely delusional. She’s in extreme denial and only hears and sees what she wants to.
If only there was an option for a gif-like format that allowed audio to be played alongside the video... I guess the technology just isn't there yet
Carmichael is near the bottom? Find that hard to believe. [NAME] just under McDaniels? Words cannot accurately describe how inaccurate that is.
"Ohhhhh man, too real. I spent way too many years with full on raccoon eyes and just accepting that's what makeup was."
" You're lecturing other people and you can't even spell ""Dwig***H***t""."
"I believe that you should tell him, tell him lovingly it may help him understand how much you were really hurting"

"Haha I’m not expecting anything at considering they’re 2,000 miles away from me. I’ll be surprised if she does give me numbers,"
"I mean, let's not pretend [NAME] wouldn't be screaming murder if this happened at Spa instead of NVA"
Which is why I'm glad he turn around as he did. xD Still is both scary and funny if you look at it from a different light
"Haha, maybe at the 55 title party in May "
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but she is more than likely dead and will never get to say goodbye
"Waahha, ohh, they massawaaa... STOP IT. YOU CAN ACT LIKE A MAN."

"Rude to NXT. They need to just let her go. She hasn’t improved in over a decade, she’s never going to"
Not threatening? It is an exhortation to commit a violent sexual act against a woman.
She's getting younger and younger. Which wouldn't be that big of a deal if this post didn't exist

What did the dyslexic atheist insomniac do last night? He stayed up all night wondering if there was a dog
It's a shame you're sticking up for a dictator who orders the beating and shooting of protesters in the street.
Focus on yourself and not on finding a relationship. It sounds like you have a lot of personal issues to work on and are projecting your problems.
Which doesn't excuse the fact that he wanted to see sexy pictures of a 16 year old. Gross.

"Can I just say that the Elizabeth Line is still a bloody stupid name, and no I don't think I'll just get used to it."

It's shaped fine. It fits her. It looks great and I'm jealous.
It’s shocking isn’t it? I paid less for a flight from London to Manchester than it would have cost for the train.
Alllllllways. Losing that toonie makes you feel like a rookie every time.
Oh for fuck sake. Things were going so well on the coaching front. This dude is nothing but a suck up
this is the perfect example of something that is a terrible combination without being outright disgusting.
I don't know about that. Old Liz managed to earn around $90k over the past couple of years.

This is my favorite game of all time. Thanks for bringing back some good memories!
Yeah it can feel a bit weird but I feel like Cali girls use dude for guys and girls so it's not an immediate L
Oh gosh that's no good! Perhaps the other options are better places to start
Omg I'm crying and shaking rn [NAME] would never say that

It’s a rough time I hope your Ex wife gets better.
I think making fun of him will just piss him off.
Is it just me or does the outro hurt your ears. The intro is a whole 12/10 but the outro just seems to hurt

You can't freely make a decision when your opinions are a shitty contract or life on the streets. That is not freedom.
"Unfortunately they do at times, but it's not the case in this video."
We’ve been watching OP for awhile and warned him about his posts. This one doesn’t rise to the level we warned him about.
I rarely get full manic. Lithium just took away my mixed irritable angry episodes and I'm pretty sure those aren't superpowers lol
that made me feel bad for nw

My kitten just got very happy when Pasta scored. Such loud purrs! I was happy too.
"There's no need for anger, but cringe and embarrassment are called for."
That logic leads to a very dark place if all you have are terrible people in your life.
I would absolutely claim it and yell that my Auntie was looking for it.
Legit I just go to places and tell them to surprise me. That way I get to keep trying new types of food 🥘
No. [NAME] can't do anything to me because he does not exist. He is just a chatacter in a book.
People need to stop excusing bad behavior

"while it's debatable how big government should be, I'm glad someone isn't advocating for private fire departments again. that was such a disaster"
"Regardless, fight 'em every inch of the way like it's the last hill to die on. Complacency is complicity. "
I know a couple of people who are. It's amazing to watch.
It's just a natural reaction of people blaming white people as a whole for all the bad things in history.
"No. I make jokes about it, and so does he but he doesn't actually know. "
Bro. You think roads and infrastructure wouldnt be built if it wasn’t for the government? My sentiment still stands. I pity you.

"Holy shit, if my siblings had roomates i wouldnt be shocked if you were talking about them."
"730,000 readers and only 6 posts in a week? Wow..."

I’m amazed how anti-government these people are. They have no understanding of what government does. Perhaps they should move to Somalia. No government there.

The Republicans are worse though the NRA literally has to pressure Republican congressmen every time gun control gets brought up.
"Not an effective solution. Shooter always has first move, taking out an unsuspecting teacher would give a shooter access to better arms."
Was just wondering about the mobile thing. I only use mobile and I've never noticed anything odd. It's not something people would care about anyhow.
Cant wait til [NAME] passes him. [NAME] is an ungrateful mofo. Anyone that praises their own work ethic and hard work needs slapped silly.
Not sure why you are getting downvoted for this comment. I really dislikes the Facebook type posts on this sub.

YES! I can't recommend this TED Talk enough and I think it's really disappointing that many portions of the left have caved in to anti-nuclear hysteria.
I think calling it a “meme” gives these idiots a little too much credit. They’re just weird caricatures done by alt-right idiots

Disgusting. Need to get the tooth hole fixed😂
"This is very deceptive. If you haven't read it, this article is great! The Deceptive Income of Physicians"
Worrying about [NAME] during a game is ridiculous. Especially when he's currently 6-11 from the field.
[NAME] has continued to show how selfish she is throughout the years..we shouldn't be surprised at this. [NAME] forbid she be the bigger person for the kids.
Is that the only symptoms you’ve noticed? Are you normally worried for social situation?
You've violated rule 4. Please adhere to the rules of engagement.

No one likes him enough to tell him he’s wearing women’s glasses
You know he meant Golden Gardens. You are not discussing this in good faith.
This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don't understand science and nutrition
Actually i barely remember any threads about him getting to rank 1 in recent years. Most of them were about his insane winrates against gold-plat players.

Wtfffff why can’t I have all of the benefits and none of the consequences :( :(
"LOL, I suppose so. All I'm saying is that... you can have a person and make them appealing too."
That's how I used to feel but contracting oneitis added a heaping shitpile of loneliness and agony on top
Glad to see those refs from the Rams/Saints game landed new jobs in WWE.
I never said she wasn't a downgrade. But on r/political_revolution the complaint seems to be that she didn't endorse anybody in 2016.
Doesnt have insane standards or anything. I don't see what's wrong?
"You called me a troll and a liar and you're surprised that I sound ""antagonist and confrontational""? Wow, you're impressive. Good talk."

Loathing Big Pharma has nothing to do with being anti-vax.
17f CF to the core here. I never thought of having kids once in my life! No kids for me

"Reply with ""Oh, my bad"". Don't make a big fuss out of it. People make mistakes."

*price hike for [NAME] only. I dropped Netflix last month because of it.
6% of [NAME] is [NAME] so it wouldn't be a shock if he was of this community.
I do the 4-second gap as well and is it infuriating to see someone take advantage of it.
I'd say that the vast majority of the population is and was rightly looked on as horrific. Christmas music makes me feel like a real [NAME].

Sue the shit out of her for damages to your private property.
"No, because men get attacked for wearing skirts simply because they have a penis. It's a social thing, not a legal one."

A world where I despise a good number of republicans AND democrats.
[NAME] was only president for four years dumbass and [NAME] served 81-89 dumbass this whole thing is made up and she’s a dumbass

"Fucking monophanie looking ass floating with the dead, nice."

Wondering why this hasn’t been made a thing yet 😂
"Wow, this is bizarre. Well, I agree too. A wealth tax is exactly what we need."

Learning to read was the worst mistake of my life

This guy is desperate to be a victim everyone. We can't fix him.
Don’t laugh the way this game went I actually expected he will lay it in... then reality and [NAME] hit... thanks goodness
He's done nothing to earn trust either. He got ran out of Miami

"She’s so gorgeous, I hate you too."
"I'm sorry you're going through that, I wish I could help somehow :c."
I’m a millennial and my mortgage payment only takes about 1/5 of my after tax earnings in a month. Feels so good.
"What she is doing is child abuse, plain and simple. Fight with everything you have to protect your kids. "

"I’m actually not! From USA, sadly. 🙃 Edited to add: unless you didn’t mean me, then I apologize! "
Yeah! Despite being from the east coast I've never been in the car when it's hailing so it was a full on argument. Thank you!

"Gave ya an upvote but sadly, by reading this thread its not going to help"

Gonna give up your best friend for a g huh? I'm glad we aren't friends.
"[NAME] - same fucking problem, slightly better command of the English language."

Yeah people used it as precedence. That’s very sad. What’s your point? What abhorrent treatment?
FINISH ON HER!! Seems way more appropriate for a sex doll
Let's say he quits or is fired (we already know neither will happen). Who the [NAME] would we pick to replace him?
One of things I loved about this subreddit is the use of the old school meme format
Any guy that would say that in that context doesnt deserve to have a gf.
Didn't even get a chuckle out of me. I guess its just too high brow for my dumb brain.
You’re buying a hipster truck then demanding INVOICE PORT PDICE. If they don’t broom you won’t get a survey for sure lol
Parents should at the very least monitor the childrens activity or put an adult block on the websites
16-37 and 25 fta. [NAME] is so fucking overrated. Volume chucker/flopper in a fast paced no defense league.
It's not illegal to be ungrateful. You can't force someone to take care of someone like you're wanting.
Between this and the headline it makes me wonder how he fits his ego through most doorways.
What the fuck did I just read?

I would enjoy this if it had a few more pixels.
"Yeah that’s a bit odd, wouldn’t be surprised to see that change come gametime unless [NAME] is shook or something."

And then expanded on! It's so good. Haha I still remember hours and hours spent on Friends of Mineral Town though...
"Sometimes it even feels pathetic which I know I should be trying not to be so hard on myself but, yknow, evidence is hard to ignore"

£10 for copy pasting a wall of text from /r/gamerghazi? Why would I want to do that.
"Yeah, but geology doesn’t provide enough pumped hydro. Not enough places to do it."

Seriously. I had 2 jobs and was in college. I sleep more now!
The only thing I know is that none of us don't know anything

These are the guys who eventually shoot up banks and hide 13 year olds under their beds.

Well it very well could be your drug usage. You could be depressed also. So stop doing drugs and see a therapist.

I met up with a woman who was 49. She reminded me of being old. That isn't attractive. Youth makes you feel alive.

I'm glad that you are still harboring feelings from a game that ended in 2016.

"Well, it wasnt by 31.... So im still mad."
I'm 21. I've entered adulthood and I even have to face negative comments from family members. Adulthood won't save me.
" that’s actually sad, feel bad for him :/"
So many nice things here. Good vibes. Enjoy your cake day and weekend. ✌

Sorry for having a working brain :3

"Is it just me, or do things mean a lot less when they are repeated like 12 times. This video is pretty much that"
This team isn’t winning the 2019 cup. I’m focused on 2022 and beyond
Welcome! I'm a fellow INTJ-A female. Was also lonely for a long time. :) It's great to feel home!
"[NAME] can’t you see, you’re being way too loud for me"
My organs love me. I wonder how emotionally damaged a person has to be to come up with these. It's weird and sad.
Or you just get rejected and then not murdered and your anxiety worsens until you can no longer approach women or even men.

"Slam the desk, stand up, and stare at the accuser for added emphasis."
Oh. My. [NAME]. This entire post hurts my brain. It's beautiful

Maybe don't pick something quite so obscure.... But my girl does
"That’s abuse and manipulation. She trained you well. I’ve lived it, brother. "

[NAME] was almost all around higher rated going into the draft Hindsight is 20/20

"Thank you! I do so love making people laugh, and when they let me know I did good."
Don't call me bitch you fucking sexist. I bet you are one of those white devils. How many women and minorities have you suppressed today?
I don't get it :( + Idk which game u guys talking about :(
Until he leaves for the Lakers and we’re right back in the same spot in two years after not winning shit
What is with the pet worship? Should be more worried about your elderly relatives.
That's unfortunate but can't blame that lawyer for doing his job.
My dad was on 20+ narcotics for over 20 years. Now he just smokes pot and I've never seen him happier
I want someone to take me to the hospital

You didn't watch it to the end.
These stats don't specify if the cops are in the right for killing someone
My stress levels are really too high. Let Tuesday bring some good news...
Ive done this to a couple of people. It makes me feel really pleased with myself. Just riding in circles around people.
Wonder if the balls are deflated... that worked well against the colts last time.
Haha I was about to say damn she straight up eviscerated her in between bites.
"Yup, it's pretty funny to know we technically use the metric system."
Where'd you go tough guy? You were talking so big before. Way to downvote and move on punk.
"While I agree, that doesn't necessarily means we should take those 3 in the first 3 rounds. It really depends on the players available. "
You don't have a point. Yes there are aspects of crypto that is confusing. Getting confused between buying BTC or BCH is not one of them.
"My only criticism is xhaka, too slow on and off the ball."
"was i replying to you, you fucking degenerate? off yourself ( in game ofc )"
I hope [NAME] does get a new devil trigger. I’m sorry but seeing the same one repeatedly has gotten old.
"No, it's a back massage at best. At worst it can give you a stroke and kill you."

Yes he is. Cling to your safety blanket for now cause momma [NAME] is about to snatch it from you.
It's special if you're into it. Some women genuinely enjoy it.
"At this point I am questioning your sanity, you compare a guy with 40/34 goal seasons to a kid who literally can't hit the net"
I played in the WSHL last year and this really isn’t a surprise. It’s crazy how unbalanced the competition is in that league
"I kind of hate it when I agree with you, but definitely do this time. "
Well that just sounds delightful. Where was the exchange?
I can't even imagine the stupid tattoo I'd have if I got one at 15. Probably like a Red Bull logo or something
Who gives a shit. Stay in your fucking car.
I get that but there may be some folks out there that aren’t like that. Any help would be much appreciated.
"I knew I recognized this road! Damn, glad she's okay."
look more 4th grade comments. sorry you're a child who has no brain. I bet your mother wishes she had a child who lived.
"I think it was, it was do scary, i honestly never wanna do that stuff again"
"Uhhhh, existed... Ever been to Arkansas? It’s boring as fuck."

"That says to me that he believes you are the issue, not his mother."
"haha I'm guessing she doesn't spark joy for you, so you can let her go "
I love how you are a individual just trying to be yourself. I always say sexuality is the least interesting things about yourself.

Its nice but irrelvant. With [NAME] and [NAME] there I only see a no deal exit
LOL how can anyone trust you when you pretend that you voted for [NAME] when your clearly racist against blacks. Your user name is strictly a lie.
"It was weird indeed, but I liked it too! (Maybe because I’m a musicals geek)."
"Oh boy somehow this got political remember every ONE, HOLY, APOSTOLIC, AND UNIVERSAL"
This one is sad but also very good
nah man im just shook and dead™️
cause he constantly hates on [NAME] for no reason other than Petry having the puck on his stick more than anyone else on the team
It also why there’s a 30 year drought going on 31 this year :D
Why is it an issue getting him off the 40-man roster? Just put him on the 60-day DL
This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
I have a bad one but I also have mild cerebral palsy on my left side
"[NAME]? Nah, that's him in the background. The idiot with the leaves is [NAME]. It's always fucking [NAME]."

You look like a bear.... An ugly cartoon bear
This is the scariest thing I think I’ve ever read on here. That is just so horrible.

The dude was absent in the Ohio State game... IDK I would be very worried if he was the pick.

I used to really like [NAME]. Now she is the worst :(
because energy drinks are the most fucked up you can get while still being sober
It's not vague at all. No one aside from slave owners thinks anyone has a rightful claim to another persons life.
because people are idiots and don't like being wrong
"I really hope not. I want a more feel good intermission, I’m done with being yelled at by angry old conservatives. "
TL;DR No more Superbowls for [NAME]. Get ready for another winning season that ends in disappointment.

You forgot our dear friends from Paris
"Only 150 calories for two so it's not as awful as a tub of ice cream. Still a bad message, though"
Yea ur right on that but that doesn't really negate my statement on the blitz.
I feel horrible for the government workers caught in the middle of this. I hope it ends soon.
"Okay fine. Still though. Make some joke ""maybe we should cuddle for warmth"" and see how she responds. "
"Wait a minute-- is this you, [NAME]? Awkward... "
I can do that too but I have diarrhea
Yeah but how is that even possible if 99% of girls who are out are with friends? That’s pretty intimidating
For Citynews dot ca that is really sad.
Yeah imagine if he had been as efficient as the beginning of the season. We would have at least 2 more.
"No, you have the right too. Pretty crazy, but awesome thing we have. Freedom of expression."
I could crush him like a bug right now.
No she would just get 18 years in jail (raising a kid).
my parents got engaged in the courtyard of [NAME] back in the 70s
we were frauded the whole time about how pure she is. turns out she's actually trash.
i hate [NAME] and 20 good men
"Sadly, that theory is plausible in the lds inc realm of thinking."
My main issue with Anarchism (although this should probably go on anarchism_101) is that i don't see a difference between anarchism and syndicalism.

He said this awhile ago. His splits away from coors scares me.
Unfortunately this is just as illegal as impeding traffic all over the city.
The third floor isn't high enough. I'm also in dire need of a job and the stress is unreal.
Lol I don’t think it’ll change anything.
You sound quite childish and unable to engage with any information that doesn’t conform to your narrative. Sad.
"When someone is that crazy, it's probably best to deescalate and go about your day rather than risk them doing something truly crazy. "
Same.. First thought was damn that kids shoes
Turkey bacon is some worst processed food. Enjoy

Guess i'm unnatural then. Excuse me that i don't want to die from a heart condition at age 30.

"My friend on PS4 said that if you don’t stay to kill the bear, you can’t kill it."

That whole episode has some heartbreaking moments. It is probably my top Parks And Rec episode.
The worst part is the character in the image behind it is great and this just hurts to read in his voice.
I'm ashamed it took me a while to get it
No worries! Hope you enjoy it as much as I have! :)
"Ooohhh shit, they did *not* just say men should be decent human beings, they've finally taken it too far! Gather the troops! /s"

Nah. I just need to stop answering before I go to bed. Got the post and the replies mixed up in a sleepy haze.
"I've been watching a lot of mavs games, I don't think we want [NAME]..."
“[NAME] = [NAME] = [NAME]” 🤣😂 It truly takes a DEVOTED moron to embrace that nonsense.

Players like this makes me rage quit tbh.

"I said in my original text post that I don’t think Venezuela is socialist, and I stand by that statement."
"errrrrrrrrr that's pointless, and your Doctor I'm afraid is pointless as well."
There is no assuming the worst. Its experience and taking things at face value.
I don’t know about the whole state but we do have some shady cab drivers here.
Lol dream on buddy. You’ve had enough attention today. Actually learn what your talking about helps a lot. Sorry your stuck in free roam smokin crack
When I was in Uni I worked in a call centre. Pay was better than retail but it was worse on the soul.

Talk about an oldddd school shit coin.
The worst is ‘get in a group with someone you don’t already know’

Glad to see Tael (wabi) on the list but surprised its not at the top.
Imagine thinking like this. I feel kinda bad for them.

"Definitely not Fox News though! That’s the real stuff, zero lies or bias there!"
[NAME] and and [NAME] still look the same ahhh
Oh jeez!! I didn't know! I retract my message.
I remember them looking very happy. I loved that they were there and seemed very happy about what was happening.
"The guy who I consider the best lover I’ve ever had, had the smallest penis. "

Can’t see him doing well in the premier league tbh. Wouldn’t be surprised if he ends up wishing he stayed at Dortmund.
I recently got a job that I wanted so now I don't have to live paycheck to paycheck.

You gotta be a fucking idiot to use a regualr wooden pallet for a bale. Blue or Red pallets only
Is it though? All the highschoolers I knew were too broke to be using juuls. Everyone had a suorin and the only ones with juuls were drug dealers.
Instant karma for an impatient jackass who doesn't deserve the right to drive.
I didn't know that newborn babies eat and breathe through an umbilical cord. TIL.
Hey man. A lot of people have criminals in their family. That doesn’t mean they are I think you need to take a step back
£20 per child?! That is ridiculous! You can’t buy much of anything for that! I am furious on your behalf!!
I'm now scared to post this link]( I guess I should [stop.
That's sad. You can be acquaintances with women. Not like you are driving them to the nail salon or something .
Oh my [NAME] give her as much food as she wants!
I had one of those... my cat broke it.
The toes stretched out as he hangs from the swinging door is too much cuteness for me
It was pretty cool seeing him play all the horrible games based off his childhood stardom on AVGN’s YouTube channel. Fucking [NAME].... Bane of my childhood.
Some people have no shame or sense of self-worth. It’s sad.
the fuck is wrong with this guy
Please. I can’t even with these comments.
You may have been watching a tad too hard bro lol No judgment here
Pretty sure they claimed he resisted arrest. If I remember correctly he was just peacefully sitting on the curb when the cops decided he was resisting.
Not really it’s a capitalist organization based on earning. They play to peoples fear and love not their environment
Left or center is more aesthetically pleasing than right justified.
"Lol, no one can say that because you don’t know who the fucking shooter is. What’s going through your head?!"
"I disagree with you, therefore you must be an idiot. K."
When you're too stupid to realize they showed off character customization in the trailer...
I'm not sure honestly. I think there's a fanmade audiobook but I've heard it's pretty bad. Sorry.
I'm one of those students on odsp. I'm screwed.
It’s called concern trolling. Don’t be so gullible and quick to politicize everything.
"Human nature also leads us to greed, violence and aggression. Natural doesn’t equal good. Cancer is natural."
I'm accusing you of framing [NAME] for murder. Where are your records?
You look so happy now 😍 Hope you are doing well and that you get everything good you deserve. ❤️

"Alright then, I'm glad to hear that. I hope it's handled in any case."
"Even though it should level out, it's still currently having major detrimental impacts on the environment and human suffering "

"True dat, I lost hope a LONG time ago"
Yea he messed around with a 33 year old man dating a 14 year old children. Alabama is one of the main stream media lies.
"Can we not say ""Team [NAME]"" or ""Team [NAME]"" etc. That's too close to us style politics for my likes..."
they should just stop broadcasting road games
"already exposed when h2k went 2-16. Sure they didn't have the best players, but going 2-16 means the coaching staff should also shoulder the blame."
"I couldn’t believe that. I’ve been mad but never enough to throw my PHONE! GIRL, what is you DOIN’?"
I made friend with one of these scammers. After speaking to me he quit his job at that company. We still speak regularly over whatapp and facetime!
I just mean symbolically it's weird to call your own flesh a 'blanket'.
also that fiat (if paid in Bolivares) will quickly depreciate in a week
Obviously a flying monkey somewhere. What a nightmare that guy is. I'm glad you cut him out of your life.
"Shhhh, don’t say that, your going to trigger a millennial "
Not that I fully disagree but this seems a lot more like a rant that you want people to back you up on rather than a genuine question.
Never thought of that. Now i dislike Heaven more than before.
"Welp. That sucks. I always check left and right when crossing an intersection, getting T-boned is one of my biggest fears."
Several of the scenarios in the ad were talking about intervening when boys were attacking/bullying other boys.
Fuck why didn’t I think of that
Being ugly and confident does not mean you'll do well in dating. You'll just try more.
"I provoked by breathing too hard. And yes, I hate that. "
Luckily every elevator would be broken at all times.
It wasnt a terrible idea until [NAME] got injured and [NAME] got complacent
I'm sorry to hear about what your sister did to you. I'm glad my videos could be of help!
I would give it a day before people started changing their minds if we had this option
I could not agree with you more! These selfish women crying abuse to manipulate.
"Didn't even knew that was a thing, eitherway it would be nice to have a back up page just in case"
I'm sad I had to come this far down to find this.
yup - he threw [NAME] under the bus with no guilt
This was potentially the most dangerous stunt I have ever seen someone do. One minor mistake and you die.
I miss it but it was op
Seems like you're another guy who hates legion ;D
Ah yes... the scene where he revealed himself and finally came out of the.... Shado... 😏 I’ll leave. 
"Didn't expect him to land back in the championship, although mears was much more unlikely"
>This game is dying because toxic people like you ruin it. Speak for yourself
Lol nope. She helped me alot through it. I'd say [RELIGION]/parents made me miserable
My dad loves playing sport......the sport of slam dunking my arse for a touchdown
No... There are many ways to prove you are [NAME]. I've heard of people that proved they are [NAME] by showing that their mother speaks Yidish.
"I swear, I don't know where the bombs are! Only the miners know that!"
"I think this qualifies as r/prorevenge, honestly. Dude needs to face consequences more often, otherwise he will keep trampling over people’s boundaries."
Not any meaningful amount as far as I can tell. Although I’d love to be surprised
I appreciate this. If you hadn't done this I would have felt terrible all day
[NAME] is phenomenal. It’ll be a sad day once he’s gone
I don't think fantasy draft has been a thing for a few years in career mode.
"Well attention whores are women(mostly) that always seek validation from other people, something that can really become very obnoxious and annoying."

Tbh it really is a long name. And pretty unusual for a ring name.
Someone get fat boy [NAME] a happy meal.
Let’s get greedy and take back what is rightfully ours
I visited NYC 2 summers ago and I have the same exact feeling as you do. Glad you liked the city just as much as I did!
Your meme is bad and you should feel bad
Oh my gosh. This woman who died also had a son who died. Holy tragedy
"Yeah, apparently they're wrong. It is a bummer and only getting worse, it seems."
That sucks. But you can find another SO. You can't unhave a kid.
#**i have decided that i want to die**
I feel for the dad curled up at the end of the bed like a loyal dog
"[NAME]! He was just amazing, best contract ever, so sad when we lost him. "
"Also worth noting that OP was the racist, violent instigator in that situation."
The right time would have been never being there in the first place
I threw my only book away so I could go catch Pokemon creatures
"For me, she looks happy and nervous as well to meet to her future husband´s family."
There’s a big difference between “I felt bad for her but there was nothing I could do” and “not my problem.”
Its almost as if everyone is too afraid to be politically incorrect to admit that height and race are a factor.
Can you imagine not being able to pick your nose THE WHOLE GAME ! Those poor bastards.
Most traffic violations are victimless crimes and fining people for them is wrong.
"This is not surprising at all. She's a fake trendy ""feminist"" with no perspective whatsoever."
Now I'm wondering on what I've been missing out. Again thank you for this.
thats terrifying. how can people do that to their own citizens?
"Oh wow, you are strong did you report him?"
"You know when I typed ""legal tender"" I had a horrible feeling I was going down a rabbit hole."
Looks extra creepy in light of the recent revelations about his campaign.
I have and it didn't help. It's only a matter of time now for how long I can hold on.
My friends that were badly injured from the first fight. Read my backstory comment.
This wasn't exactly aimed at the national brain trust.
I will dude. Have a good one
Victimless crime? Fuck you! Sounds like your unrepentant for being a crippling alchoholic.
"Guess we don't need to be afraid of hell, then, 'cause we can easily get out."
Ugh. Just legalize it already so this silliness can be put to an end.
"Damn never heard of that, I stand corrected!"
>Make I've never hated a commentator more in my lifetime then him
That's an insanely rational and expected response to someone with whining parents.
Good to know everything is about average there. Leave it to H-Town to hold it down.
As The Pot Bro's always say. When the Cops ask you questions. Shut the fuck up.
They are the best but my office is so far away 😞
I feel digestive regret just looking at them.
My blood pressure Edit: I'm just happy to be here.
"Hi u/CareeningDirigibug, thanks for posting this however I am afraid it has been removed as this video has already been posted within the last week. Hope you understand."
"Same, I feel weird when i thank something unaware, but I feel worse when I don’t thank it"
He wasn’t drafted and is properly rated imo. Had a crazy career for sure. Beat the odds many times
It's bad enough when the Jocasta syndrome is one-sided. This is a pile of yikes.
Wow the [NAME] replies appeared in less than ten minutes this time!
"No it’s not, I can give you multiple examples of cops getting physically assaulted and not even using their guns. Stop lying."
They’re trying to escape the crushing oppression of gender roles. It’s not a fun sexy fetish to them the way it is to TiMs.
"Please, please, please don't do that to yourself. You'll end feeling worse when this guy leaves you. "
"If they lightbulb doesn’t change then it’s racist, sexist, Nazi scum. Am democrat just playing along. "
He is proudly swimming in his cesspool of a personality
Stop spraying chemicals daily in the sky.
"Yeah, I don’t get paid 30 million a year to get my a** kicked."
Cognitive Dissonance. Big problem in our society.
You need to look in the mirror if you going to say that [NAME] is overrated yet want to trade him for scrubs like Dedmon
I think: Congrats! That baby will now have loving parents
She doesn't have to pay anything this is just an opinion of a lawyer. No court ordered that.
"Came here to say exactly this. It's almost the same scene, as if he tried to recreate it"
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** aerosvision! ^(hug)
"As someone who has polluted their body with copious amounts of sugar, I somewhat doubt steroids are any worse. Abuse anything and it will hurt you."
I just have never found that area very attractive. Also from what I understand there is a lot of contaminated burial sites around there.
"At least he was polite - ""please"" fuck off! "
Hell it was made clear when I was in High School 5 years ago that we aren't playing a game that's ' too violent '
[NAME] SHOT THE PUCK *AND* WE SCORE Who woulda thunk
"kino = german for 'cinema', so a cape-kino would be a superhero movie. took me a second, too--my brain was pronouncing it like cappuccino"
[NAME] wasn't apart of that team. That was [NAME]
So what's so funny about what you just said?
A year ago I said that this continuous ISO by Houston is disgusting to watch. It s still disgusting.
You sound jealous that a seed hasn’t been planted in you
Yeah no more concussions in Madden now. Only non head related injuries occur.
You’re a women hating racist. That’s what you are. Stop talking shite and trying to pretend otherwise
Sacrifice the individuals rights for the greater good of the community. That's the definition of fascism.
Nice job. I'm surprised not a single one of them used their CC immune ults or had beads. That is usually really important in assault.
Really sucks that he's not going to retire a Sounder.
What a political whore Uncle [NAME] is!
bournemouth v chelsea took under 3.5 3-0 then in the 95th minute bournemouth grab another. feels bad man
"Because you're not making one in any coherent way. As such, I'm done. "
>CFMEU Any excuse to act like thugs and not do any work.
That sucks I'm sorry. Ive always been dismayed at how flippant people are.
[NAME] i really hate entitled people. Upvote if you think that EPs are worse than Antivaxxers.
I'm all for finding ways of reducing gun violence but this seems to just be arbitrary and capricious.
I really hate this family. Nothing but snake-oil salesmen who's negative influence will reverberate for a new generation of young women who deserve better role models.
Ugh. This is horrifying. Thank you for sharing.
"Relatedly, my legs are lean because I run away from my problems."
"Wow, I remember having this kind of meal a lot as a kid. "
I’m convinced WB is more of a pain than it’s worth. Good luck making adjustments during the semester. I feel your pain.
It is. It’s so bad. Then I start blaming myself for liking them. It’s like I have no control over this.
I miss him so much during the NCAA tournament.
SO FAR I couldn’t even listen to all of zombie bastards and ckth was mediocre
r/outoftheloop here; could you explain why this is good? I'm assuming he's a scummy shitlord.
We're not a democracy. WE'RE A COUNTRY
Didn't u just say ur new to this? Why are you speaking?
That logo looks cool in the morning lol almost cyperpunk
Now I see why it takes me 30 minutes extra to get home if I miss an exit.
It's not Russian land either. Your argument is still complete nonsense.
Me thinks this crosses the line of dignity. Makes me sad. It’s one thing to expose things but another to mock it.
Really funny how our FO liked the 2 of the worst qbs. [NAME] and [NAME] That’s why I’m skeptical about our FO now
doesn’t help for me unfortunately. i think if anything when i’m on BC is when i experience these symptoms
2005? I think we might be the same person lol. What a terrible year. I go back to that one a lot.
I like how she dabs on the way down.
"damn you're prolly right. only character i actually hate is [NAME], i'll use a different word"
It looks like they do but random redditors do not. What a surprise.
"That sounds like it was an absolute nightmare, I'm sorry you had to go through that, anesthetic failing is a horrifying experience. "
I shouldn't be tanking this much rating after even a year bro. You don't understand how bad it feels to be in this garbage elo.
"true I am a troll, but fortunately for me I'm not emotionally invested in it."
"I hate the argument too. It betrays and exposes the violent, primitive ape amygdala response that is most Human social interaction. "
It's weird how quickly I agreed with you. Usually I'da been more incredulous.
Yes!! THANK YOU. I’m happy the point of this story was not lost among all.
"My bad, sorry. I kicked a pebble on top of that mountain."
Absolutely this is the kind of absolute hypocrisy that made me leave the church!
I don't want PR to vote because they'll vote blue. I want them to vote because they deserve the right to have representation.
"I personally am very proud to be a vegetable. Corn, to be exact. Corn pride y'all"
pretending the issue is your wife cheating on you is why you're not learning anything
"You know I never thought I'd celebrate someone's death, but once she goes I'm going to have to try very hard to not enjoy it..."
Six shots on goal for [NAME] and still nothing. This breaks my heart.
She's one among 435 members of the House. You're giving her an awful lot more authority than she actually has.
"imagine his wife dumping him after that, it would be a BIG L"
You're not my STBXH hehe. He doesn't type like you.
That convention center sized groan right after the reveal.... No one wanted this. I have no idea what they were thinking.
It doesn't justify singling one guy out when the whole team played bad. Even [NAME] had a bad game.
"Canada here, yup..... gods damned homophobic leftovers."
"I might be interested, been playing 5e in a couple campaigns now, happy to talk further!"
"Funny enough, not all [NAME] are celebrities."
I never knew this! Nuts are a total fear food for me
Oh my god. Don't you know it's illegal to share memes if you don't have an IQ of 16 trillion?
I got a lot of withholding to throw me into anxiety.
Makes me sad I'll never be with a beautiful woman.
This sub needs a damn support group for people that were personally victimized by [NAME]
"If I see this gif one more time, I’m going to lose it"
Get [NAME] back on the wing. Looks awful in this position
"Maybe, I'm just saying that there are players with more talent out the gate than him."
If we can’t even score on the power play pulling the goalie made no sense
"Yes, I realize that. All my other relationships have been a year or longer but even a month into those I was miserable "
I would do it but honestly I don't have any other [RELIGION] friends.
"[NAME], that is so horrible. I’m so sorry for you and OP."
"Awful tattoo , looks like a child ! Get your money back and money for laser treatment."
"Yeah, when I saw she was in LA, I really hope that. Oh please, be true."
I dont think all of us do. However I think the ones who actually do are unfortunately the loudest.
"Well, if you are gonna put it that way, I guess I don’t have much of a choice."
"For some reason I wanted to be a bartender when I was 8. After hearing this story, makes me feel I missed out. "
We absolutely can't leave the first three rounds without an offensive tackle. Preferably Round 1 or 2
"Love this. ""Where were we"" and ""what were we"" before birth? It really helps to think this way"
Wha? I'd love more background on this.
"Yup, that's exactly what happened when the alt-right took over the sub. So glad I won't get banned for saying that now."
I can't believe that you trusted Napolean and Kip to feed Tina.
I do that too. I just feel oddly uncomfortable when I'm doing a task and there's no noise in the background.
"Let's see, collectivized commons leave less grass on the ground and wreck the economy. Nope. The tragedy of the commons still holds true. Try again."
Dumb people. Poor person. The wolf was the only one who wanted to help!
Ha! I like the way they feel all over each other.
What's the fucking point of this post? Is just baseless claims with no proof to back them up.
It's weird because sometimes I care and sometimes I don't. Although I wouldn't call myself an asexual I could be leaning more towards demisexual.
Yeah but being happy at other misfortune is sowing bad karma for yourself.
Definitely not a dead human body. He’s probably just a weird dude that has some weird thing in his room that smells terrible.
Damn that’s a big F from me :(
This is getting out of hand! Now there’s two of them!
The gov puts the DUP and monkeys in the same figures so it's hard to guess
"culver's is good shit edit: not saying that you were saying it was bad, just to clarify"
We aren't 4th anymore since our goal difference was just destroyed. He's not going to be sacked yet but losing to Huddersfield would be inexcusable
As anyone else ever **needed** waffles before? This winter morning is killing me.

"I did, I did!!!! Now I feel special "
"No thanks, I prefer my [NAME] with red laser-swords."
"Ah it's too complicated, I'll start dating dudes instead."
Being lonely without him is far better than being lonely with him. Good line. I'm stealing that one!
read that as 'Belly Racing' and tbh i'm a little underwhelmed
I used to do shit like this...back when I had a serious drinking problem I was in denial about
>i told him we weren't sick we were just on drugs. Lol unexpected
I almost feel bad for China.... but the culture has a major problem with having 0 morals.
So sorry for your loss! I lost my cat 6 years ago in 2021 due to terminal autism. 😭😭
If I died I've always wondered who will be at my funeral. I imagine only my mom. Maybe one of these days I'll find out.
"see, i'm over here thinking ""i hate sports"" now if you could just take my balls and go home"
"Ah, I read it wrong. Jzk. "
It must be really sad and lonely under your bridge troll.
Pleased to meet you. Hope you guess my name.

If you know anything about those sources then either you understand the dismissal or we aren't going to agree.
Kicking out a child for a biological trait beyond their control objectively makes him a bad father.
My pleasure ☺️ hope you enjoy! She seems very sweet.
Fuck the fucking refs. Seriously. Fuck those fucking cunts. I'm so fucking mad. Fucking dickless fucking street walking fucking sluts.
Sure hope #4 includes subsidized housing. I'm terrified.

I will never forgive and never forget for this one
"I'm a Broncos fan. I'll never, ever root for the Chargers, Chiefs or Raiders. Who the fuck would? "
The tactical alliance between PYD and the US doesn't fit the characterization of intervention. That's also not relevant to what the hashtag is about.
"Good [NAME], what a waste of [NAME] time. Wait, is [NAME] a nutritionist?? WUT?"
I'm starting to think im being rased by narcissists lmao

Ahhh India. Where she would have been raped 17 times on her daily commute.
"Aww, look at you still wearing your hospital bracelets even. "
It’s sexual harassment because it was done with a sexual mindset. It’s not that hard to understand.
"Oops, forgot to translate from UK lingo "
"I dont know much russian, but all I heard was ""Oohhh fuck. Shit."" (Rocket launches and explodes) ""......shit."""

>Doctor: So do you cancel a lot of plans you make with friends >Me: uh technically no
Thank you. I needed to hear this. Currently kinda spiraling pretty bad
> Do you think Amazon reviews are don't mean anything? Yes because they are very easy to game.
That’s horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.
Please just give [NAME] some rest. He looks tired.
That's not what he meant. He means the use of a lot of different hashtags.
Who spends the whole night there? One or two hours max and I’m done
They didn’t cite a source. On top of the spelling mistakes. It’s why you don’t trust infographics for stats.
I'm mad at the process and happy with the results for Thrill tonight.

"even though its alot of work, i got 100% this weekend, and that scene re-opened the wound, lemme tell ya. what a masterpiece"
This is the type of response I give people that are toxic in Rocket League. They're just fake and cowards lol
I just physically *shuddered* at the idea of redoing middle school..
I like how the last picture is of [NAME] beaming smile and not even so much about the tattoo at all.
You don’t understand the design of our government.
Soundboard operator needs to start blasting duck quacks whenever we block their guys
yes but this is a crazy person. That's like telling Two-Face he doesn't have to flip a coin before committing a crime lol.
You didnt even ask the parents if they agreed to let him in the back?
So juicy i'm surprised the man from Del Monte isn't knocking at his door.

"That sounds like it was an absolute nightmare, I'm sorry you had to go through that, anesthetic failing is a horrifying experience. "
Given I had zero interaction I couldn't even be mad. I think I chuckled
"Exactly what I was thinking. ""Oh, I'm sorry, let me just undo that for you then"""
I'm not even a funny one tho
She's one among 435 members of the House. You're giving her an awful lot more authority than she actually has.
It took a surprisingly long time for this to be seen by me on this sub.
It's a superfund site with a couple of inches of topsoil on it. Have fun with your cancer dummies.
"I would be unfulfilled and unhappy. I enjoy meat, thankfully I own my own plot of land and can hunt on it at will."
Score is currently 12-12 when 25:th round begins and [NAME] has 35-10 stats. Insane.
that's not scarcity its desperation and prioritizing looks over everything else
Ah yes I used to enjoy those. Before the dark times. Before the days of a FOX less Netflix.
I think it's weird that he didn't just wake you up and weirder that he didn't tell you until you noticed it was missing.
Oh my gosh she opens her gullet like a freaking pelican!!!
I had one of those... my cat broke it.
Must be so frustrating having the wrong old man facing their own shutdowns.
If too many medical professionals die then life will be worse as we cannot get medical treatment
No way! First I’m hearing about this
"I'm sorry you had a bad experience, that's horrible. But that number saved one of my friends lives. Different for everyone"
Hm... I can't help you then. I always go cold-turkey from any addiction I decide to quit. :/ That doesn't work for everybody.
>And I could be wrong about my [RELIGION] faith but again that’s the point of faith. The point of faith is to be wrong?
It looks like they do but random redditors do not. What a surprise.
[NAME] living her best life in Germany.
That is disgusting. He should be embarrassed.
"I'm allergic to the red food dye too, a lot of foods have it in there. it sucks because I adore Swedish Fish candies."
Glad [NAME] found some love in his life

"So cool! So bonkers that people do this, I love it! Do you mind if I post these on my pages?"
"Lol I don’t disagree, but the perimeter defense let them walk into the paint. You can blame [NAME] too."
I just get sad when I see people commenting on articles and videos about him that they think he's on drugs.
Hard. Social anxiety/general fear/uggoness kept me from actually getting dates and i was extremely awkward when I finally stopped anxie-puking to actually go on the date.
"As a Cardinals man i agree, makes me want to deck the cunt but hes huge and i love him, so conflicted"
You have to be a patron for that.
We have ungendered/mix sex bathrooms and I'm pretty sure people void and defecate in them too.
Can’t see him doing well in the premier league tbh. Wouldn’t be surprised if he ends up wishing he stayed at Dortmund.
1) I think my least favorite thing our kid has done would be spit up in my mouth. 2) Vomit is worse than spit up
I feel you. I hate needles and i'm a type 1 diabetic
So you reject your ideology's premise that you can just protect yourself.
I miss the bch/bsv war...the quality of posts were getting better....back to square 1
It would be funny and sad if he gets heart complications again

you won't change anything with such disdain for your fellow countrymen
"This qualifies as emotional neglect. Just, to be clear, that is a form of covert abuse and is not okay or normal."
With Everyday passing day without a good signing I feel like we got robbed in this trade
I'd almost rather a criminal have a gun than this guy.
Tell him congrats. And that he srsly needs to work on his bunting; it's just painful to watch.
"“WTF, He helped me? ...I’ll eat him last :)”"
"Wow. Forget the separation, lawyer up and go straight to divorce. "
"Instant fucking turn off, ugh. Fuck us for wanting equality across the spectrum"
That could be the biggest I've seen.
"For every Undertale or Stardew Valley there's dozens, if not hundreds of other games developers put their heart and soul to, but never catch on."
Slathered in blue cheese. [NAME] is so jealous.
does any body notice that 8 in 2018 looks weird
"Well shit, time to talk to the wife. It appears she has two husbands."
I don’t know how to write odds for an event as certain as that.
>Cannot predict now Guess it's on you now /u/smackspr!
Yeah I wish they hadn't opened the entire game with the ol' [NAME].

"You know what they say, when everyone around you is and asshole, maybe it's you who is the asshole."
As anyone else ever **needed** waffles before? This winter morning is killing me.
"Yeah they’d probably want more than [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME], maybe [NAME] can finesse them too lol"
Might not have the funds after just losing their mother and all the costs associated with that and losing that support system.
You can't argue that these are the same when clearly one of them has a monopoly over the market.
I'm actually heartened that I'm not the only one that thinks about that group. wonder if men ponder on it.
My wife is out for shabbos and I'm so lonely without her :(

Crossposting is a terrific feature on Reddit. I'm happy if someone does it to me because it means more people will read one of my posts.
"Seriously, it really made me happy! I hope when OP scrolled through she felt a little tingle of happiness too."
What the hell. Poor [NAME]. Poor you. Wow.
"Anything other than harassing motorists or worse, pretty simple."
Right? just like the shock I had in elementary school when I learned the KKK was started by [NAME]
I stopped reading in the first paragraph where they try to make Vanderpump Rules and Desperate Housewives legit shows.
Did feel that one but I find it hard to tell sometimes
"No, what’s sad is saying the same message like it’s news. He’s a copy paste machine. No original thought."

YES! I can't recommend this TED Talk enough and I think it's really disappointing that many portions of the left have caved in to anti-nuclear hysteria.
"Haha, same bro. I am lvl 21 and still playing at least 4hrs a day. Loving it!"
Enjoying it. It makes shaving my head easier.
Wow what a final quarter. [NAME] throwing two intersepts. What a dog
I’ve been abused enough by the Knicks today.
huh i didn’t even know that button existed
Meanwhile my sister won’t even hug my goodbye when I drop her off at school.
"She sounds abusive and narcissistic. Delete your facebook, hit the gym and kill her. "
huge fool just like everyone who believes anything [NAME] says weve been two weeks away for months now
Lol you wish it was that easy. Lying POS customers have the advantage with review websites sadly.
"Never made it through, it makes me physically ill just seeing images of that monster combined with him describing his incomprehensible evil."
Glad things came out alright for you...
This made me incredibly happy and incredibly sad. Sometimes this universe robs us of the wrong people.
I watched a video about fake makeup having rat piss in it. No thank you
All star is a popularity contest voted by the fans. Stupid as fuck. [NAME] should be an all star this year
i’m cry laughing though bc she panned it the exact same way i did when i was 15 and got a naked palette
"I love when they send in the wrong meat, it’s only happened to me once,"
"Oh god, How I always wish she shows up to the lonely hearts party every time I watch that episode."
He is just the exception to the rule though.
Well that’s not what was said he said drugs that kill you sooner than your meant to die.. nicotine fits that description
Thats it I am out. This sub stinks.
"Oh weird, the money I make is taxed when I earn it and then it gets taxed when I spend it"
"Thank you sir, this has made me happy. "
"There isn't really much to say to something like this, is there? Its unsettling."
I really enjoy my job but I get paid $62k I don't know if that's considered high paying but it's plenty for me.
Sure would hate to explain sodium and water to them as they sprinkle salt on their food.
"the father sending up 4 donuts every morning via stair lift to dtr, before she even comes down to breakfast, wonders if he is enabling her."
"""Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male! There are already enough girl characters. We don't need a third!"""

" ""If you don't wear BROWN AND ORANGE...YOU DON'T MATTER!"" We need a tshirt with that on it asap! "
"Thanks, I hate moderation (you must get that joke a lot) "
It's the number one reason I refuse to exercise.
"It's pretty stupid honestly. [NAME] clearly pointed a bug and people are saying ""oh, it's a feature"". ...seriously now."
"Either way, it's at the very least not an ethical way to conduct business."
The average person here could go their whole life without ever seeing a gun. The gangs and such yeah they manage to get guns one way or another
"They never will until it affects them directly, and by then it's already in the end game for us :/"
Yeah and I love my dog and I'd miss my dad.
I wonder if the mapgen portion of the population will die in the first place. Dwarves just waste all their time working on the labyrinth it hits 30.
It wouldn’t even have been a month yet though... I can’t believe this bootlicking nonsense is upvoted here. [NAME] supporters everywhere these days smh
"I'm not saying to hate them, I'm wondering why this sub just started worshiping them."
Wow! Look at that spine shine! You handled her perfectly!
"What are you talking about, as a 30 year old man i still munch on those"
">more money than you I seriously, *seriously* doubt that. >doing something before this guys are outta the country Prove it."
It really is. I didn't know a thing about the feud and it caught me off guard how brutal it was. Enjoyed it a lot though.
What country? That sounds like a sad septic system. I'm sorry.
Be adult Pay taxes to govt Be deemed incompetent by people with different views Feels bad
What the actual heck.... Like I just don't....I cannot
It would need immediate medical attention and hospitalisation. Might be fatal due to liver failure.
Well I'm glad I decided to go to McD's instead of doing those lines!
" No way, man. We're gonna keep on rockin' forever. Forever. Forever. Forever..."
I'm mad at the process and happy with the results for Thrill tonight.
It doesn't matter. You can pick someone with the #1 Pick that will never be any good...
In all honesty no slip shoes do actually prevent slips like 99% of the time. This guy just seems to be the unlucky minority.
I don't care about [NAME] story but I surprisingly found myself liking Bristol's.
"Those are horrible things to say to a child, let alone a 3 yr old. I would be pissed!"
😭 I wanted her to be on the top 4; now we’ve heard plenty of times [NAME] mentioned so pretty sure ain’t gonna happen
Damn I didn't realize we just locked up the season series against the jets. That's good to see.
"I was looking for this comment, was not disappointed."
I usually see tweets like this for girls but it feels nice to have it directed at boys
"> I also could care less Back to school, again."
Ah the high life. Must be sweet.
"Man, I miss those days. LA is pretty much dead now."
Only children are scared to take trains by themselves ...oh wait.
"[NAME] could rebound and still be overpaid, depending on how hard he rebounds."
My biggest problem with Yuri on Ice is that it didn't have enough episodes to show the payoff of their relationship in my opinion.
"Epic didn’t take the rights, Skybound chose to work with them. Blame Skybound not epic."
"> All the complexity was lost in Oblivion, and it was a huge disappointment. So you are agreeing with me?"
"You’re a life saver, wish you a blessed new year "
Would love to share this on twitt and FB ...
What's sad is that I look like this and I'm not a virgin. What's your excuse?
It’s ugly. Bye bye and good riddance.
"I am in fact a woman, but I'm not bothered by the assumption. Thank you :)"
"Overwatch. Dota 2. Rocket League. There are plenty of games that implement loot boxes well, and are the better for it. "
Crude but other then that I don't see any issues.
"Traded me away, the bastard. Kidding aside, it's the annual r/hockey trade deadline game."
I feel like that’s not the best spot for a beach
Just doesn't really work if the DM doesn't want it to...
I could never deface my car like that omg
I stopped watching after I had to suffer through a whole episode without [NAME] removing his shirt
Im 13 I can't get a job..
That's terrible. I'm sorry for your loss.
Imagine making a homophobic joke when your name is /u/Lebronlover23 OOF.
I want to give you reddit gold but I’m poor and bad at money spending so have my love instead
"Watch your back u/Youareapooptard, [NAME] might hunt you down and burn you alive for that relatively minor insult"
Must be why I'm alive. That sucks.
Because I was a fan through all of those NFCCG losses...
I was flabbergasted when I saw it.
"Utah roads are definitely some of the best out there. Anywhere else I have lived has had either similar or worse, or waaaay waaaay worse"
Will that's what that poor child was just taught. Some parents have no idea
"I can’t change that it’s just how the site works, I wish I could but I can’t "
So now we have [NAME] King and The Prince. Nice. I'm not even mad with this transfer lol
I love Wayfair! Just started using them and am impressed. Sounds like UPS sucks. Enjoy your couches! Haha
Interesting considering my tattoo looked like this when it was fresh
These refs have it out for the colts. I didn't realize we traded our MVP 11 to KC either.
Definitely surprised we took out [NAME] there. We needed to finish the quarter strong and it went straight to shit when he left.
"You should be much, much more worried about a rise in fascism than pedophilia. Thinking that pedophilia will be normal is just plain paranoid."
"says you, too bad you're totally wrong."
I hate that I was young enough to not remember this but old enough to remember the next Super Bowl....
"You know when I typed ""legal tender"" I had a horrible feeling I was going down a rabbit hole."
Haha good theory but not the case. I'm completely aware of when I'm intoxicated or not.
"I mean I still attend regular school, this is just a Saturday school. I'm just frustrated that I have to waste Saturday on this"
I wonder if these little creatures with their big bulgy eyes ever poke themselves in the eyes accidentally.
Odd to think that most people in this photo are either dead or just about into pension age.
"It's rape after they've both consented? You're what's wrong with society today, try to be less of a dipshit going forward."
"Might get hate for this but I'm reeeeaaaaaally not a fan of [NAME]. I don't know why, but I just don't LIKE her"
Can relate. The spirit kept telling me to move to the Morridor. Total decade+ long disaster in almost every way. Shoulda stayed where I was.
The planet is being destroyed. ***yEaH bUt TaXaTiOn Is ThEfT!***
Wait that’s actually funny why is it on this reddit
This primary doesn’t deserve this nice birthday.
>This weird exploding ice [NAME] I haven't seen before? Wow. I... that's some ick right there.
Right there with you. 20 years together and suddenly its over. I'm tired of crying and hurting. We'll get through this.
"Turn undead is once per short rest, you can’t make use of it frequently, no wonder the dm was frustrated"
Implying there was a shootout in the restaurant? I wouldn’t feel safe at all if I were caught in crossfire
"Apologies, that distinction always slips my mind lol"
OMG are you serious? Do you know what episode? That's horrendous! I'm really disappointed in [NAME] on that one.
"You know, ive always wondered how a car could get in a position like that"
We could cure child cancer and pictures like this would still make me happier
People have always liked kinky sex. But this is just BAD kinky sex..
There’s a special place in hell for u
"Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in..."
"Lol what a terrific audience. Maybe rich people saying ""come beg"" is kinda like wtf bro."
"Damn, I was really hoping for some comeuppance at the end, but at least you no longer have her for a boss, so silver lining."
"Good catch. I guess I was just remembering the shift after the first debate. That's pretty sad, tbh. "
It is physically impossible for [NAME] to get bad skins.
You can do it but it won’t be easy or fast keep watching craigslist.
Using Vtrigger and Vskill buttons!? Oh My.
"Insofar as the Church has definitively ruled, it has been against evolution."
I have an idea. Hear me out in this. Maybe we shouldn’t get upset about [NAME] until.... they...sign... elsewhere? Too radical?
I don't like sleeping in the couch :(
My goodness. Your such a fucking manchild.
Fucking hell! I've been out there protesting orange people all this time. I need funding for new signs!
A sad amount of time was spent making this.
I might get to phaneuf traded levels of joy.
THAT'S why it's so cold here in the Midwest.....Hell has frozen over. /s
NBA is like Westworld only completely opposite. Every time you act like your true self you get a T lol
“To put us all know who [NAME] laughed through it all.
"Well, that took a left turn. Sorry, you're not going to go viral, boss babe. "
Hey leave me and my 11 year old Thai wife out of this.
[NAME] is not good enough to get that angry.
I hated broccoli until my parents tapped into my obsession with dinosaurs and got me to pretend I was a brontosaurus
Wait so did you permanently lose sight in one eye or is this just temporary?
You look like 1 of those ISIS fighters got shot in the head
Hated her. And that was honestly a more offensive reaction than everyone laughing at her IMHO
Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
"Definitely, I'd do that. The league pass deal isn't awful though."
They are unable to think out of the box
every time you see the snake edge and still get hit even though you *swear* you were holding downback
"Well I don't think it works the other way around. As someone who is incredibly insecure, I am also definitely not a narcissist."
Someone just vandalized this poor guys car in the target parking lot lol
> they look like such fucking OCs. [NAME] designed them I don't know what you expected. He phones in video games all the time.
You didn't come here to debate. You came here to excuse abhorrent behavior.
"Really? I find being left alone better than being harassed, honestly."
Goddamn. I'd tap the fuck out if I was that other guy.
"You fool, you have no idea that you talked about team fortress all along!"
That guy is just eating downvotes left and right
"I just got banned from one of his subreddits, I haven't been this excited for a ban since the snap from /r/thanosdidnothingwrong!"
Imagine being that much of a useless parasite
"Wow, so he was pulling his own little mini [NAME] scam. Explains why he couldn't use your reporting tool."
[NAME] that was so awful I collapsed into a singularity
I legitimately want to brutally murder this person for saying that about us autistics
Did you just call me a *bitch*?? You will NOT disrespect me like this TODAY!
"I'm so sad for you, I'm so so sorry. 💔"
[NAME] punches here are so desperate and have absolutely zero power in them. He was outclassed so badly twice in a row after such a dominant run.
"Because it contains the nudity of a child, and that is a federal crime?"
Thank you!! I really enjoyed the first song and the song by The Avalanches. Both were very melodious and charming.
I didn’t actually know that. I wish I was surprised.
"For real. After I saw that, I just stopped reading. My eyes spun right out of my head. "
"Yeah, empathy, a hell of a drug ;)"
I don't think we can threaten them with something that's likely to be illegal to convince them.
"It would be mostly home-grown terrorism, angry at all the people fleeing from overseas terrorism."
He gives political answers to political questions. He's still interacting with the public unfiltered and I can't imagine any CPC Prime Minister ever doing similar.
"Missed that part, but now I see where you are coming from."
Wow this was awful. What kind of audience do these morons have? I mean no one with the money to buy that junk would watch these fools
It is part of the political game unfortunately.
It would be nearly impossible to get to the point of being immobile/bedbound without someone enabling you hand and foot.
"""they can't come through the port"" He's obviously never seen The Wire"
"He can’t do that! Shoot him, or something!"
Is there much of a population? I wanted to play it back in The day and then they changed it into an almost entirely new game.
"Someone will actually spend their money on this too, that’s the sad part"
Appreciate the love man!! It's a fun game!
Your ass after I beat you so hard you shit yourself
[NAME] looked just as bad as [NAME].
"We all were. Because we’re the responsible people watching the show, and not the glorious train wrecks starring in it :)"
"That's the idea, don't be so indignant that I called out your bs."
[NAME] rolls with his kitties and is hard as fuck.
"To whoever entered a flamewar with me a few months ago for saying [NAME] was dangerously underweight... Yeah. That ain't ""healthy""."
"[NAME] is a turd, but I actually believe him here. I'd be stunned if he didn't have a bigger offer than what [NAME] reported."
Thanks for your kind words. They made me tear up a bit.
Only because you aren't as educated within the realms of the game but does that matter? No
Don’t I know it! I can’t believe this breading station thing is so enormous.
"Good, don't want speeders in my neighborhood and keeps taxes lower."
1200? I thought it was 12000! Ohhhhhhh. Dr. Now’s not going to be too happy with my weigh-in dis munt.
[NAME] damn it I hate when enemy keepers use their hands and stuff to keep the ball outside their goal. Make a mistake pls.
What's there to disagree on..... it's pretty apparent
I'm so happy you said this. I just accepted that I was going crazy.
"There have been some really good replies in this thread, I hope they help you too! :)"
Taco Tuesdays after meatless Monday. I call it meatcycling
I didn’t say for how long I’d been in it. :) Maybe it was made of ply board and garbage!
They call it the hub and spoke system. They neglected to include a wheel.
"Aw, she came home early to surprise you! She must have missed you a lot."
"Nah, girl, you did great. I'm also shocked by guys who want to hook up without a condom."
Hahah Yea imagine what the GM guys will do when the DD app crashes for hours
Reminds me of my favorite [NAME] post
"For sure. I am infatuated with sharks, and much of that obsession comes from absolute fear haha. "
I swear these people would try to sell shoes to someone without feet.
"Really worried about NISA translating it, but at this point I don't care any more, as long as we get an english version of it."
Apologies. My point still stands. A .8% lead is an insignificant majority at best. Saying one demograohic is most of the population is a bit misleading
I never used the word mean. Chill. I said weak and it is. Its sad aswell.
Way too much bounce in that pad to get enough height. Needs natural grass. It was doomed from the start.
Woah! 4 new maps in a year! That’s so lucky!! Not like we got 10+ maps in 2017 for bf1..
Idk I’d kind of like [NAME] to come up next year. [NAME] still scares me a little. Not saying I don’t like the guy
I wish. But sadly my job relies on other people so I just can't be the sole person
Let's get skinner locked up for 8 years first. Don't want to upset him before he signs
Sadly that's probably the worst game I've ever seen [NAME] play.
"I'm saying [NAME] is the pretentious one, and that the original commenter's response to him is a perfect mockery of the asshole "
I’d go [NAME]. [NAME] gets raked on any mistake I throw personally
got enough rubies 😁 librals wouldn't know what saving is even if it hit them in the face! 🇺 🇸😎🇺 🇸
The sad part about this is that these memes are more Gen Z if anything...
Why does everyone hate the creme brûlées? They’re easily my favorite.
"well the irony is that felons are discriminated against, even non violent offenders."
Or they just don't understand why cats do that with kittens.
#RejectingIslam because it is the *ideas* [RELIGION] promotes that turned me away from it.
I enjoyed the effort from your dad so I must downvote but I want the subreddit to see this so I’ll upvote
"Hey, that's awesome. I'll be sure to think of some questions for you in the future."
"Yep. Tough week for [NAME]. Not shooting well, first ejection and fine, ripping out jerseys, first triple double and the DSJ drama. "
"I wish [NAME] would debate [NAME], if he was alive :(. "
"Considering how much they project and accuse how often they others of only hating X person because of their race, it makes sense."
Sorry man. I didn’t know you were on reddit. Didn’t mean to steal your stuff! I totally would have tagged you
"Ahhh, I see. I thought you were saying they made you afraid of the sessions."
Then check out their full line! You can be offended by all their herring names!
"You're not, because I don't either. But I can still search Twitter. You know what else I found? Your evidence was deleted."
"Dont want to come over as a sadist, but the story makes all those scene 100x better."
It's so much worse with a child involved. I'm so sorry you have to go through this.
Thank you.. Makes my heart happy that someone can appreciate this thread :)
"I hate this, and I hate you. But actually I love this, and only like you."
Damn this was deep. Hope the best for you and you could really turn this into a short story or something of the such.
I mean everyone already knows what u like so its gonna be weird
"Omg, the kitty bites the knee and then looks at the human to gauge reaction."
I'm thinking I'd be wondering how I got my hands on a time machine.
"Colts fan here. [NAME] seems like a nice enough guy but, holy crap, terrible coach. Buyer beware."
I hate to say it but....... I quite like this as a format - the burger and fries look shocking though.
"Wow, *only* 7 exes. You are definitely FA."
Intolerance of intolerance isn't intolerant my dude
Looks like I posted it. Oh no!
It feels like it plays worse tbh
"Nope, nope, nope and HELL NOPE! "
Look at that piece of shit covering his badge number. I hope he loses his job over this. What a lowlife piece of shit.
"For us to be able to do that now, they would proably make us pay for it. "
This is so cute and wholesome? How is this terrible
"Thanks man, I will have to check it out!"
"I forgot context and thought you meant the band was republican, please don’t worry me like this again "
Oh [NAME]. So it looks like a head shot with a 50 cal.
Makes it even weirder that she now hates America
"I’m sure losing obj will help [NAME] get out of his slump, or help develop whichever rookie qb they bring in. "
"omg I remember be exactly like this and being so excited, gahhhh I might even believe I’m more excited than you hahahah."
What law did they break? This is just another example abusing a system for profit without the necessary laws in place to protect people.
[NAME] looking like his fucking controller disconnected
thats messed up...thats why i dont like reddit as much
"Nope, although I have some Serbian-American friends there who danced for the Tamburitzans :)"
Yes I was feeling bad that hes friends left him
"I bleed it out, chicken tikka just to throw it away..."
I can't believe he came in and 4 seasons in he managed to turn the team into this.
[NAME] fucking christ. When [NAME] came into the league he was pretty much as skinny as [NAME] is now. And look at the dude now.
He needs to be tested. And you need a divorce lawyer ASAP. He needs to move out. Actions have consequences.
She's not more than 17. And I love teenage [NAME]. Don't want her adult.
I'm disappointed by him not bragging about his 99 level atheism.
You can't vote here anyway so it is a moot point.
I feel a little sad for her. That she thinks the only options or something to do is having kids. Fuck her tho.
I'm making small steps to change my life
"Turn undead is once per short rest, you can’t make use of it frequently, no wonder the dm was frustrated"
I feel like [NAME] would be upset about this too
I was thinking it’s sad that a team that hasn’t had a FRP for what seems like a decade has a better record than us.
Poor eyes. Can’t even see and is sent to the trunk.
That shit sent me on a fucking journey to read.
Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.
I like they think that it’s bad that we are thinking about the fucking POTUS. It’s almost like his actions effect us all

A great way to start the new year. Happy New year everyone.

"Ok I was wondering thank you I seen alot of different ""opinions"" on it ."
"Yeah, my schedule has been brutal for the past 2-3 years. This year it has become my objective to get more involved to get-in with more parents."
The miracle was just that. Because we all know the Vikings would fail the next game.
"That’s too bad, I didn’t know that."

Nothing seems to intrigue or satisfy me only drugs and thats sad.

This is about as close as I can get to singing IRL. It's fun.
I would agree. It's unfortunate and brutal in its content and in the responses in the thread

">Emotions like this will get you killed. That is too bad, considering I was planning on living forever."
"That's not a healthy way of thinking. Obviously that dude was troubled and, without proper help, he would have done these things regardless."
Here a great example of what adrenaline from fear and panic make an animal do.

Same. Right after I replaced the screen. So now I have a cracked phone
Wow! You are close to me in age. I would never do that.
I enjoy fixing problems. I think of it as a task that I can achieve. People get to overworked when they set too unreachable goals.
I did not know Donuts could be so complicated.
Stunning considering you have the exact same opinion.
It's like a car wreck. You can't look away.

I regret that I have but one downvote to give.
"Upvoted because [NAME] is a good boi and can’t help it, but tbh it makes me sad to see him struggle like that..!"

"Oh no, they down voted me, they canny take patter :'("
Yup. I’m assuming cause it’s live crawfish and early in the season? Idk. I love crawfish cafe but not for that price.

I am sorry but I can feel a panic attack. Holy moly I would die instantly If I were him

Is it that common? Here on the tube on London there is barely room to breathe let alone spin so I guess we avoid this kind of crap
"Its very obvious to me he is still in love with her. He is definitely not in love with [NAME], the marriage will be a disaster."
I... can’t tell if sarcasm; because literally all of those positions involve cynicism.

What a sad post. I cannot believe people actually follow their advice.

It's to bad I live in a society that only wants my continual existence.
"Just watched The Pass on Netflix--really great movie, but not exactly a feel-good time..."
Can you imagine the amount of backlash she’d get if it was ANOTHER [NAME] collab? Omg.

“Got caught talking about meditation” Sounds terrible I am so sorry you had to go through that kind of thought policing.
Look at that thing...could tear you to shreds
This is oddly wholesome. I love it.
"I know, right? Our genocidal hatred should be targeted towards [NAME], where it belongs!"
Being demoted for having the best ideas in the office doesn't sound like a good business strategy.
Never. I miss the opportunity of leaving earlier than I did. That’s about it.

I blame [NAME] for this series of unfortunate events
That's the stuff of nightmares right there
I could've done without the bottom right pic.
"And he's also in the way of playing time for [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]. [NAME] fits better as third option on a playoff team."
Not super subtle with my water tool on top though. Thank god for my backyard!

Why all the downvotes? It's a fucking pizza thread?

"This is not a good relationship. It doesn't seem like she is ever good to you, only manipulative."
I never knew this! Nuts are a total fear food for me

Both the odour AND the smell! Poor guys.
"I wonder why the fuck out of this alive. well, there was a perfectly reasonable explanation."
"It's creepy but also sad that the guy was bathing in your fountain, hey at least it wasn't your pool. "

Considering the mass amount of seasonals they hired this year I wouldn’t be surprised.
"There are assholes who think that these are ""their trails"" and do this sort of thing."
I disagree. In that I believe that season 3 was also very good. I think it's better than season 4.
Just saw your history. Makes complete sense now. Your a trumptroll. Bye.

I like how you're insinuating that the other half is family reunification rather than giving us the real answer.
You severely misunderstand the evidence if your answer is 'NO TO ALL' regarding your questions. Especially the last one.
"No, I have been avoiding doing anything until it's actually fixed because I don't want to give them any reason to drag their feet."
This is my favorite reddit conversation I’ve seen in a while
Having fuck tons of fun right now
[NAME]’ ego has turned him into such a bully. He seems to get off lately on witch-hunting and encouraging his “sisters” to harass people.
"The Donald raiders are the most savage of the bunch, they not only downvote brigade but also annihilate civil debates "

Banning abortion causes way more harm than good and is evil to be against. Same with requiring suffering people to suffer. you seem evil
I totally thought that this match would be a draw due to [NAME] interfering. I should never make any picks in the pick'em contest ever again.
As comic book guy from Simpson’s would say. WORST. WRITTEN CRIMELORD. EVER....
It's irrelevant though. it doesn't need to be specified in the title of a post.
Wow 40 years at 18 wow how unfortunate.

[NAME] to me will forever be proof that the true dangerous people are not the ones telling lies but rather the people that believe them.
[NAME] was I wrong and I'm glad to be. 🤙🏾
There are so many posts from [NAME] on here it makes me wonder what people think wholesome means.
And they wonder why they don't seem trustworthy. Maybe someone should tweet about it and they'd notice.

You’re not winning this one. Move along.
I think some people don't understand that they don't do him any favor by putting too high expectations on him.

That feel when your friends are all relieved by your insane driving skills.
The contempt from [NAME] in these threads lately is seriously disappointing.
He's also a chaser and is convinced that shouting at someone is an escalation from a shooting spree. He is incredibly dumb.
This can be taken horribly out of context
This seemed so out of character but I was like cool. Weird.
Right!? I'm glad someone else noticed. I was horrified when she trespassed into a stranger's home. So violating!

"Honestly, I have a hard time sleeping in socks. The fuzzy ones are the worst because they slide around on my feet."
I will be surprised if this actually has an impact. Just a few statements about the importance of the commitment to defeat ISIS and the withdrawal will continue.
I mean I don't think he's gonna come out and call [NAME] a bitch even if he feels that way

"I'm just concerned about [NAME] health. Do you think an old, ugly, fat, stupid person like him should be eating such unhealthy meals?"
I accidentally swiped. I don't have time right now I swiped for ego and got it so I don't actually want to talk to anyone.
That happens and is his own fault. Glad he's gone and Juve have [NAME] now.

"Nah, I knock on the door from inside, or the wall, or tap the floor, seems easier"
"Oh, the horror! We must defend the honor of Lord [NAME] against the scum of r/NFL!!"
It's not uncommon for OTPs to not use their mics or stay out of chat all together because of all the flame they get.
This is delusion beyond what I'm willing to engage with.
Idk why you're surprised. [NAME] and [NAME] had identical philosophies. It's why the offense didn't change when he came back.

Sorry I'm a reddit noob but why do I get notifications of comments on my thread but then they disappear and I can't read them? Lol
You told me it was pointless to point it out. You're the idiot

"Oh, wow, I didn't know my Dad had a Reddit account."
Glad to hear. It seems like a very hopeful sign. 👍
Wait so I shouldn't try to sell my shavers by telling my customers that they aren't good enough and could do better? Damn.
The double standard. Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy.
DONT BE NEEDY. TALK TO OTHER GIRLS.
Downvote me into oblivion but both [NAME] and [NAME] shot around 35%. However one they say he balled out and the other one was struggling.
Ive given up trying to understand [NAME] motivations if I'm being honest

wouldnt like most of the pokemon fanbase be adults now tho
I like [NAME] as a person I just don’t want to see or hear any sexy times between her and [NAME].
I now understand why everybody gets pissed off at these weak ass pump fake fouls.
I hate the way [NAME] kisses people. Like smushing his face in a figure 8 on their lips. Ugh
It always makes me super happy when I see stuff like this. Go live your best life girl!
This is not a comedy subreddit. It is a subreddit about the unexpected.
I wonder what would happen if you did the same thing to him.
And still so few go to college): Such a broken system.
Ask for a pic without the hat on. That hairline must be chilling with [NAME].
Did I say he was a scammer? I said he's disgusting and there's nothing endearing about him at all. Not surprised this subreddit is defending him
"Another bad essay by me, sorry for butchering anarchism, anti-ableism and anti-psychiatry but I hope I got the point across :p"
Don’t do it homie. Think of what it would be like for your kids.
"This is such a lame idea. Instead of getting better and outplaying your opponent, you just want to make your opponent worse. Sad."

"I actually see this one a lot. ""Allergy: fire ants."" Me too, bro. Ants will fuck you up."
surprised he hasn’t mentioned [NAME] after saying [NAME] the best manager/coach he’s ever worked with
First season got a lot of attention. I didn’t like the second season as much
"$42,000 fine over a JOKE is unreasonable. "
That is disgusting. No one should act like that to you. I'm so sorry that happened.
I think you overestimate the ability of politicians to rig the vote c.f. May 2017
Exactly. A soft no is still definitely and distinctly a no.
Maybe try to do some little thing you really used to enjoy. Even if it's just for 5 mins it's still a small victory.
You guys really took this loss well. I'm stunned at how not-salty you minor leaguers are taking it. Totally not full of excuses and what-ifs.

They do not need to. A majority of the vox populi think like you do.
"Seriously, way to miss the point. Even if no liquid falls from their eyes, they suffer immensely."
I have two and nothing has ever happened to me. The media doesn't want you to show your support because they want supporters to feel isolated.
Cool. Would be happy to know if this worked out for you. I had wasted a bunch of time like you did and was getting frustrated.
"Racism is as racism does - so yeah, goin' out and willfully doing racist shit is indeed racist. Not too hard to grasp."
"Not sensitive, just scared that a sub I enjoy will become divided and will have in-fighting."
It certainly reeks of the same kind of scam.
It happens way more than you think. People are repulsive.

That’s not what I mean Him being a snack is just well

Idk what tf that is😂.... Don’t hate me guys!
The USA welfare spend is quite low per gdp compared to first world countries. The safety nets are ridiculous or nonexistant and the inequality is ridiculous...

It'd be a real shame if someone killed it and stole its soul.
"Right, but we want to shit talk them directly. Not agree with other people shit talking them."
[NAME] hates us man. He’s a stone cold killer.
I do not trust our defense at all. I do not believe you can increase the range of Andujar.
You really dont have a day off do you
The only time this movie should encourage blindfolds is when watching it. Then hopefully you won’t witness the giant plot holes and terrible ending.
If you like this than go watch My Self Reliance on YouTube. Start from the beginning. Very relaxing and fun.

I like Chick-Fil-A but I don't go because of their political stances against gay/trans people.
Omg this.. completely relatable and depressing.. yay for us.
This is all I can think about when I see these things. Most of them cannot be properly washed.

That's crazy; I went to a super [RELIGION] high school and I think I can remember 2 girls the entire 4 years that became teen moms.
Everyone just called me the bad guy and said they're glad she's marrying him and rejected me and that i deserved it.
Yes. I hate everything that has to do with my depression.
"You know, I'm rather disappointed, but admire your cunning at the same time"

I enjoyed the effort from your dad so I must downvote but I want the subreddit to see this so I’ll upvote
Please! She’s my #1 choice. The rare mix of super likeable and hypercompetent. Like [NAME] mixed with [NAME].
I don't know about you but parroting racist lies created specifically to devalue AM sexuality is a pretty serious indicator of racism to me.
I made a post about a month ago saying [NAME] was trash and it got over 100 downvotes

let's just forget about [NAME] performance of so emotional
Good. Nevsun shouldn't be flaking culpability in this matter. They are directly funding the organizations responsible for it.
[NAME] is not good enough to get that angry.
"He posts on The_Donald, you're arguing with a brick wall"
If he feeds the RBs and designs some QB fakes that actually fool defenses I’ll be happy with everything else
Two overtime games on championship Sunday? We are blessed as football fans. Too bad one game had to be between FYTB and FUKC
"with his luxurious salary, nice pension and zero accountability for anything it does, its a hard old life!!!"

Great vid but horrible grammar. [NAME] i had to read the title 4 times
I can’t believe you’re comparing drug use to interracial marriage. Racists like you disgust me.
The fact this isn't a [NAME] Attorney at Law Gif about this makes me kinda sad.

**Lost** children. Issues we face today are likely fabricated from the bottom up.

They can quarantine us but if they come for woofers we riot.

He thought of it but we don't want his mother's house to be wrecked by the staff.
"Yeah, he does. Just because he draws different conclusions than you doesn't mean he isn't reading [NAME]. Get out of your little bubble."
Thanks for posting this. I'm going through the exact same but I wasn't gonna post anything about it.
I don't think you could actually find something that's *unambiguously* racist. That's just how dog whistles work.
what a surprise i never saw coming
I've invested 9 goddamn years watching these twits. I'm going down with the ship.
"*Samsung Other Android phones don't have Bixby, that's Samsung's BS (and yeah, it's terrible. I have the button / feature completely disabled)"

"""*You can sifu stance your bitchass on outta here!""*"
It’s hard to be negative in that situation.
Refusing to pay someone for work that they've done is theft. You can try to justify it any way you want but that's what it is.
Almost totally gone... Let's see if we can guilt this loser into rescinding the medal
"Cheers mate for the correction, i saw Prestigeiskey's vid and couldnt remember exactly when but knew its coming sooner than later. "

With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn’t be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
"Once I saw who posted the video, I was certain I knew who it was, and I was right. Glad to see him back in action!"
This is almost as effective as posting that sweet photo of [NAME] old band
I don’t think that can happen here.
Free with a price of $600+ if you want full standard collection or maybe $300+ if you grind with no life. What a deal!
What a crybaby. Don’t drink and drive.
"That’s not munchausen. She has a diagnosed illness that’s a terrible, terrible one to suffer from. This is a pretty shitty reply."

I met up with a woman who was 49. She reminded me of being old. That isn't attractive. Youth makes you feel alive.
Her absence is probably the greatest present she can give you. Enjoy it while you can.
"I was a [NAME] fan for a good bit, so that swayed me a little towards his teams"
I believe you copied and paste from somewhere or previous answer. We are definitely not talking about the same thing. Hope you get better man. Cheers.

"He had one poor split, and he already looks strong, fuck your mindless hate"
At least a feed of diazies stops me shitting the bed over the idea of a man wearing a dress. Uppa fuckin erps!!!

I enjoyed the 1:50 seconds of this person going about their day uneventfully
They said that about Standard Oil as well. No company is too big to fail provided the state is stirred enough to take serious action.

"yep. And there are jobs I still would want done, they just shouldn't be government"
I'm so glad I saw this!!! Now I know how to wash my face! I can't wait for the tooth brushing tutorial🤗
I would stay away from [NAME]. Apparently his injury got infected and will require more surgery/surgeries
I wonder how many tries it took to get the spacing right
I’m going to die right now I’m so scared tears and snot everywhere
[NAME]’ ego has turned him into such a bully. He seems to get off lately on witch-hunting and encouraging his “sisters” to harass people.
"Besides it being hard and fucking up your kettles, irons, hair and taps?"

"Nice, Butt Stallion just chilling in the background"
"But still, crying ""castrate all pedophiles"" because they could be potential rapists is like crying ""kill all men, they are all potential rapists."" "

The diagonal photo is killing me. Why is it like that?
You aren’t mentioning the specific position and the industry. Not even in what country you are located. How can anyone offer advice?

Thanks man! That feels good to hear. I’m glad someone is on my side and finally understanding how I feel about this season.😄👍
What in the fuck was [NAME] doing there
Victimless crime? Fuck you! Sounds like your unrepentant for being a crippling alchoholic.
Watch [NAME] left arm and hand as he's on the floor. Scary.
The most cringeworthy thing about this is that they have missed a golden opportunity to say pizza time.
Weeb is confused! Weeb hurt itself in its confusion
Where did you hear this? Sorry I never heard of this and I'm kinda interested now
Can relate. The spirit kept telling me to move to the Morridor. Total decade+ long disaster in almost every way. Shoulda stayed where I was.
Sucks dude. For social creatures we're pretty inept at socialising and helping each other.
Wait did he actually do this? Seems like it would be insanely disrespectful to you fellow craftsmen.

Which is weird because it also looks like dog treats
"Only when I started to suspect I was shadow banned, so like a couple days ago. Apart from that no."
5’8ish my guess. The one thing that blew me away I went to a COD event was how short majority of pro’s are
"Ahh damn! Gotta pay attention to that, never even knew!"
Same. Not being hateful to the op but I don't see the connection.

I wanted to be a forensic scientist towards the end of primary school but high school science ruined it for me too.
"Not a good time to make life altering plans like moving in with him right now. Good luck, though. [NAME]"
Just wondering why they called the cops but not an ambulance seeing as how he was covered in blood and disoriented.
I would never stay at a hotel that had people ringing a bell at the bar nonstop. Not to mention the gong
I'm sorry for your loss. From the picture it looks like he had a great life if that helps
"I pirated this movie last night and can confirm: it's truly awful. Not just lacking in good, but *aggressively* bad."

I have the worst memory ever. Idk if it's from all the weed I smoked but I also have a blank mind like all the time.
Worst ending ever! I won't spoil it but this one sucked worse than the avengers last movie!
Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.
Not surprised...he has ZERO interest in finding a job and living like a responsible adult...

Fuck Up would be more appropriate. Fuckin marketing wankers.
"Humm, just a few days after I unsubbed. You aren't luring me back again though r/Murderedbywords !"
[NAME] said Monday was Columbus Day and those two bought it. Unbelievable.

"They are children, they have no souls. "
"Ugh obviously that's not what I meant, what I meant is that *socially* if they have a sibling that they do not need humans *socially*. "
Greasy bastards are getting part of what they deserve. Some fines just don’t seem to be enough sometimes

"Don't blame me, I voted for Kodos."
Lol seriously. I mean Vardos was really cool but other than that the story was so bland and predictable.

You’re trash april. I’m November 2000 actually. Damn we’re old.
Wow that's just like when I sing it
you almost blew my fucking mind there.
Stop trying and just do it. Then decide if it’s worth the effort. Otherwise this is just envy.
Well the cops would probably become even more corrupt in covering things up to protect their buddies from losing retirement
Now put the poor thing down you valley boy donut.
Yes. Some shows get canceled before they can even finish the season
> traffic through there in the summer is awful because that’s where everyone wants to be. your life starts to revolve around bridge time.
Thank you [NAME].. Another disaster you created.
They didn’t even respond to my email so I don’t think it’s gonna work
Am i the only one wondering about the white scrolly bar at the top of this post that has the intro to the story?
It's actually somewhat maddening to me that there are people who watch his video and actually think he is doing a public service. Yikes..
"The anniversary march was held in Derry Sunday past , not one mention on BBC itv not a thing. 14 people murdered in cold blood. Nothing."
Seeing him RT rev gave me some hope which hurts worse
This is great editing! I know this took a lot of work/time. Awesome job!
I did not even realize he was injured...
sad that the Euphoric tipbot is no more
All of Disney is cringey. It needs to be stopped
muh racist history! its all gone! no one will ever know about my slavery and being a traitorous vermin! help meh!
I laughed at this 4 years ago.

It's harder to find a decent picture of him
"Didn't expect him to land back in the championship, although mears was much more unlikely"
"Run, run Run for the roses Quicker it opens Sooner it closes Man oh man oh friend of mine All good things in all good time"
"Keep spreading the word fellas. Wishing you all a great 2019, love you guys and the whole community."
The right time would have been never being there in the first place
I'm not a health threat. I'm vaccinated and have no children. Thanks again for your uninformed analysis.
"I like the sound of that, shes definitely a bitch what does chutzpah mean?"
I care too much about what others think. Constantly trying to cater to their feelings or worrying about their opinions.
Yea this past season her outfits were horrid
I know they finally gave Return of the King best Pic but my favorite out of the three was Two Towers. They are all great though.
Congratulations on the job interview! NParents seem to give the absolute *worst* job advice. I'm glad that you've figured that out earlier than I did!
"I still enjoy the content here sometimes, but....finally! This post nailed it."
Damn that’s a big F from me :(
"I find it sadly ironic that a man's job is to protect his family, yet if he's alone with his children they question their safety."
It's actually illegal to do this. Only allowed if absolutely unavoidable.
I think the biggest fucking thing is that apparently reaper has a goddamn family himself.
I like to think I do but idk my advice could be awful haha.
> He is not sexist and not a transphobe. I see you've never actually listened to him or read his work.

This kind of sacrafice should cost at least 100.000.wanting it for free is what shocks me here most.

This is sort of wholesome in a weird way
The USA welfare spend is quite low per gdp compared to first world countries. The safety nets are ridiculous or nonexistant and the inequality is ridiculous...
Yeah cheers. Hoping it's gonna be better. Happy early new year to you too.
My favorite [NAME] post-match celebration hands down.
"I love reading positive stories!! Happy for you, OP!"
Don't worry. r/fireemblem is obligated to bash fates whenever it can [NAME] I love the entire scene so much. ~~Too bad it ruined the song~~
If somebody is fundamentally unsocialized chances are they behave socially inappropriate in more than one situation

"I'd just feel less out of place, I guess. My SA makes me feel like I'm so behind my peers in terms of a social life"
Oh I never knew you could do that
It's not unique and its decidedly worse.
Sadly the Request a Book of [RELIGION] requires a phone number now. But if you have theirs it might work;
"Hahaha I wish I was that witty at the time, I think I was still in naive shock at the rudeness of people in retail. "
"She had really bad chronic back pain from what I can remember, so was self treating with alcohol"
Yes - sometimes I see amazingly detailed little faces. It's so weird.
"Yeah... we are. But hey, misery loves company!"
The faces in that drawing are kinda horrifying
I high key thought this same thing then it was sad boy hours when I broke things up
delusional about dread being a scam (don't know how this would work) and more of these conspiracy theories with zero proof/
The comments under that video are disturbing. People actually see this as a sign of the end of times.
I must be getting old. Much more likely to be horny at 2 pm.
"unrealistic, the little fuck didn't taunt post-kill"
How is one not amused by that? I can't imagine being angry even if it was my lunch. lmao...
oh I thought you were calling OP loser my bad
People are often too afraid to speak out against the status quo though.
"AP can tell them to leave, and then call the cops if they don't. Soliciting/begging is not allowed on Target property. "
"I never read it, but I sure remember being creeped out by this claymation version"
Because [NAME] had a foot injury that I think he sustained at practice for the second half of the year.
"Bro, he left his team in the middle of the game... idc what argument you have with [NAME] you still left your team."
We need them both. My heart can't take another year of wasting deGrom gems in late innings.
"OK, so I still primarily blame the US. What's your point?"
"Honest to [NAME] make it stop, it's old news at this point omg."
This comparison pic kills me! Stassi looks like a California Raisin!!
"I highly doubt he's still her friend, and i would be surprised if she remained friends with [NAME] if [NAME] chooses to stay with him. "
This post is another reason why I'll never go back to Heroes. The loot box RNG was so cruel to me
"“…Don’t try it, [NAME]. I have the (moral) high ground!” "
The tree actually moved!!! Who is this guy?!
I believe it was clear I disagreed. And I don’t play wow.
Being a complete idiot and blocking a road in front of a bar. Which is where most cops tend to hang out trolling for DUIs at 2 am.
Merrily merrily merrily merrily something something scream... (I am not creative)
"Wow! I’ve never seen so many deleted comments, and that’s saying something."
"Whew lad they're bleeding employees, reminds me of [NAME] before they bit the dust"
This is not looking good for China's typical method of say whatever the other side wants to hear then do nothing.
It was less painful than a bee sting! I felt so silly afterwards!
You can see the regret in the eyes
Man you'd be shocked to know some women still remain passive even when married.
Really? I thought this joke was a bit plane
Say what? He has been playing for epsilon till now. Never seen some real accusations on him cheating. I think you should read some more.
"Stop calling them immigrants, that’s a lie. The term is “illegal aliens”."

It’s not so much that I enjoy money and more that I do enjoy scamming people.

Anyone from this sub that's caught posting in that thread should be banned from here. And from life.
He’s not a young offensive mind and that offends people.
Good to hear - I am glad you at least have that choice.
Thank you [NAME].. Another disaster you created.

"All that interesting information and you get 3 upvotes , feels bad man "

Terrible... children are innocent and precious. This is so barbaric.
Yeah maybe shutting down all those barracks near the border wasn't a great idea.
No one is going to create more competition for themselves
Bad news dude. You're almost 100 years past that.
It's not just me that has enemies for life then...
If the uncertainty bothers you then you probably need to have the dtr talk. Also be aware that conversation could end the situation if the other party gets uncomfortable
This bit was more fun than it should have been.

We had a train break down in saskatoon people were waiting for an hour. The cops were walking up and down the cars giving people cell phone tickets.
"Yeah it was, it was awful, everyone got sick, I was sick for like a week after that event."

Here's my [NAME]. and [NAME] in front of our tree :)
Your using emotionl blackmail. Does the vet save cancer or destroy cancer? [NAME] = Vet. Your using babies and all sorts of things to manipulate. Vets only do the right thing.

The smell lasts a half hour so maybe don't go to the Policeman's Ball right after. Rye and rhubarb sounds pretty fucking mint though
I don't generally find the CBO projections very accurate in retrospect. Some of their accounting practices and metrics seem error prone.
thats some very advanced way of thinking - and I dont think I was able to do that when I was 18

I'd argue they are advocating not fighting the fire in your house when the entire neighborhood is engulfed in flames.
"It's probably an obvious answer, but it's bad around major cities and okay in the countryside."
Well that sucks. The disconnect reconnect and keeping your bloodpoints I mean. The accidental vs purposeful disconnect seems fair.
I love it when people delete their whiny comments and then try to reply with something snarky
I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who snorted at it!
Its an unpopular opinion because it kind of makes you sound lika a douchebag and its lowkey homophobic edit:meant to reply to [NAME]

"Thank you for your opinion. I think I’ve been improperly placing myself in the comments too much, accidentally misusing this sub."
Wow random irrelevant internet person has the secret goods on [NAME]. Maybe we’ll finally get to the bottom of this birth certificate thing...
"That's the weirdest dream I've heard of, but maybe you just have a high midichlorian count 😂"
Just the name of it gives me anxiety
If it's true i'm sad he's leaving but I wish him nothing but the best.
It's hard to respect them as an organization when we hear shit like this. They will struggle as a franchise to win another WS anytime soon.
"r/mildlyinteresting's stupid ""guys look at this thing I made aren't I cool??"" posts are the absolute worst"
[NAME] has been injured for a while... No point in doing that comparison. Not sure if a troll or just new to football
I'm not going to kill you... But I'm not saving you either
What a greedy person. 8 years jail and hopefully disgraced out of his profession.
"Virtually no happiness anymore, exhausted with trying, meds not working properly and just tired of it all."
I had no idea what the fuck this was about. Found the ad and watched it. It's actually decent.
i actually dont mind either of those
"We left the church, but it'll probably take awhile for him to unlearn all the bullshit"
"Yeah I'm actually pretty surprised that's not a thing yet, there's gotta be a lot of people working on it. "
"Did you miss the other guys link? I noticed you didn't make a comment towards him, even though he posted it around the same time."
"Oh wow, I feel bad for the parents, they had no idea"
"Enough already. I'm sorry that the breakup is going to be painful, but you can do much better. "
You die > mom will be sad
I think I got gout from watching this.
"But they still go around the houses, 111 is long as fuck though."
"Ok. Progress. Not only I presented more facts, I also asked some questions. Still unanswered, sadly. "
"It was a terrible, terrible thing to do. He did every day of his time for it, has expressed regret, and has not repeated it."
Well you're lying about my pun being better bitch
Wtf are you taking about? What does that have to do wi- *checks post history* **OH**
I took Hawaii ML and even I'm clenching.... this is INSANE
It's bizarre that it's considered normal to intentionally brainwash people into murdering psychos.
I tried doing this for my son but he was afraid of it.
No I wish. They don't come to Texas very often.
The only thing wrong with her is her face. Maybe she has a giving personality?
What?! I am level 20 and I already had 4. I did 5 hide outs in total not counting the tutorial hide out.
Twice in that article he implies these minority communities aren't ordinary [NAME]. It's disgusting.
"lool chill fam, u aint gotta do him that bad"
"I hope you're ok, I feel this post :( big hugs from me"
"If an addict gets clean of booze/drugs, you congratulate them! What a horrible crabbycrab to try to shut down someone who got their addiction under control."
"Ugh, he sounds like a slob and you should leave him."
A mix of useful idiots and active grifters. It's a sad sign of our culture that these people make a living this way.
"Yeah i know that feeling, i don't know if they abandoned it, i ordered this on amazon."
Holy shit I was so anxious reading this. I’m so sorry
Because learning another language is cultural appropriation. This people are pathetic.
Oh [NAME] it's [NAME] against dinosaurs again
"If you don't get that hook one shot combo with hog now, it's over. Not looking forward to that when I play Hog."
Oh I haven’t even found those! That’s hilarious though.
To be fair I was in that crowd and there was barely any room to move.
I once had a guy yell something obscene from the window of his truck and throw a half full beer can at me too... good times
hard to bound with half team who leave after every season
Oh thats weird. It opens the google maps app installed on my phone so i dont have that problem.
When I was in Uni I worked in a call centre. Pay was better than retail but it was worse on the soul.
"6'3 guy who wants to be the smaller guy here, [NAME] i feel you"
"My knees, I had to quit running because they got so bad. Even hiking starts hurting after awhile, especially on long downhills Also glasses and deep voices"
The Babylon Bee article makes me worry for [NAME] comic tastes.
"It's a pretty old and actually funny joke, just converted into a ragecomic. "
Does this remind anyone else of the Rublev USO17 QF? [NAME] is obviously further along than [NAME] but you can't argue against the results...
Why exactly would I be talking to other men about sex in any circumstance? I'm not in prison
Cant wait til [NAME] passes him. [NAME] is an ungrateful mofo. Anyone that praises their own work ethic and hard work needs slapped silly.
Yea this past season her outfits were horrid
I spent the entire time trying not to yell at the TV. [NAME] and [NAME] can fuck right off.
But why does your horse have a leash on her while eating. Looks sooo uncomfy. Poor bubby!!!
"The one coach I didn't want to lose, but with a new offense coming in, not a move i'm entirely shocked by. "
"Apologies, got a little carried away. "
"Me, for example. I am very very happy."
"No offense, but you are jumping in conclusions that may be as incorrect as blaming [NAME]. "
Thought they would be his least favorite band
"Pretend you are the lead in a movie. You will probably get laid, confidence is everything. Bingo bango, great night!"
Looks like the next level of a horror character
"No, I mean one of the team's home grounds was literally a high school."
i didnt realize i was avoiding a question. i am afraid to talk to cops to be honest. even my own mother doesnt know what i saw
"Don't worry, you'll get to keep your same plan. It'll just double in price."
I feel like I got lured into a fever dream by a normal combo video's beginning
I'm hopeful but going in with tempered expectations. There have been some remasters in which I was really disappointed. BioShock comes to mind.
Ah. I should've noticed that after my grandma shared it on FaceBook
No. And not near as much as a gun lol
Rural MO. The nearest Whole Foods is an hour away. I can't imagine too many [NAME] could handle the distance.
"Yeah, it's pretty funny how incapable most of them are of actual satire and subtlety."
"He has actively lied about and misrepresented Canadian laws and legislation, even after he's been corrected. "
"As a former smoker, I would support it. Smoking is awful."
"love cats, dislike the regular news. you?"
It's pretty dangerous when the state decides which fictional deity is legitimate. For example the [NAME].....
hmm... it didnt work for me when i posted it but now it does... weird af
I wonder how [NAME] prepares his food.
"Behavior I'd consider deeply immoral without showing true remorse (I'm talking rape, torture of animals, that sort of thing)."
He’s a professional liar making promises to get elected when all he concerned with is a power gain.
Damn... that’s another thing I didn’t even think about it. Probably the biggest reason why people shouldn’t steal food
By the end I was I hysterics. Not a single reply from the wife too.
"Yay, I hope so! I'm feeling good about this decade."
why the fuck is this getting downvoted
Your friend should be disowned by their family
I honestly predict a riot on the scale of the 2011 ones if we undergo a no-deal brexit - possibly even worse. It's terrifying.
I'm going to Chicago in a few months. I hear Sbarro's is great for authentic Chicago style pizza.
No chance unless he smokes out of a gas mask or suffers a bad injury.
Damn. Didn't know [NAME] was still making videos.
"You fucking got this bb, one step at a time. The DD is here for you."
There are no helpful ideas like the one you're looking for. There is only one idea... Tell your parents and get authorities involved.
"Those smuggler missions were decently fun. Hold on a minute, I think I may play [NAME] again just to pass the time..."
Good god there’s so many cheapskates here trying to justify it by insulting me! Pretty funny tbh
Sadly my boyfriend's family is the direct opposite but we'll still make it work :3
What a nasty goal! Gives you chills!
"I can’t imagine choosing McD’s over Banh Mi, that’s just a complete lack of respect for your taste buds."
"As long as blind luck exists, there is no upper limit on stupidity."
The part where he carries her to the car had me howling! Poor guy was stumbling with the weight he obviously couldn’t handle
"Equipment (PC & accessories), settings, the whole transition I feel lost to be honest"
I tried to but i ended up booing the postman
I'm so sorry. This is no way to be live or be treated. It's so immature and emotionally-abusive. I really hope your circumstances improve
"Ok, I gots to know, was the child taken away? Please tell me the child was taken away. "
"The state should kill them yes, you seem to have a very low IQ and can’t grasp [RELIGION]. No wonder you took up Reddit Atheism"
"I read that more as ""shut up, hypocrite"" than ""he's not that bad""."
"I’m broke, dealing with my own mental illness, and immediately concerned with just keeping the peace."
I'm moving to the UK in 2 weeks. This terrifies me.
"Such a sad, angry person. Take a break from reddit and go take up cycling or something."
Yeah I tried to apply but with being partially excepted I think it would be hard to be a sub
You can't demand historical accuracy 'at all' then. It's logical fallacy.
Ireland because Ireland. Not me but i did something pretty scary.
I have little to no anxiety and it really helps me when i have to take a test.
Levels mate. Absolutely obsessed with our dominance.
"All fair enough, but you should start just cleaning your dishes straight after you use them. You'll be much happier."
"Wow. This I definitely needed, I'm glad I stumbled onto your comment. Helped in a major way, thanks. "
"you are trying to use post-modern mumbo jumbo deconstruction of words. Go away, idiot."
"I had a similar problem. Turned out to be technology, and overstimulation. Turned off the screens before dinner and had much better sleep."
I play with all 20-24 year old so we most certainly did not hear the punishment on the radio. Not sure exactly where it came from though.
Yet here you are mad about [NAME] being apathetic.
"I'm hoping it's more statistical noise at this point still, but it's definitely worrying."
"No sir, can’t hold them over a bowl for shit. Plus they make blunts taste weird."
If I wanted to vote I would vote Labour. Some Conservative MPs are in the wrong party.
It makes sense to me. I am a republican in that sense but hate the GOP for the most part.
Good to know ED either doesn’t affect this guy or he’s projecting hard because it’s the worst thing he can try to handle
Something I just thought of... Can you email her or text her instead of call? I find it's easier to deal with difficult people that way.
"Not loving what I'm seeing so far, let's hope we can tighten it up."
My son and I both enjoy taking pictures. It gives us pleasure. Part of the fun for us on vacation is taking pictures of new things.
"By ranting aimlessly on the internet about it, obviously ;)"
"I was so scared, I thought the kid was going to backpedal into a street."
A mix of useful idiots and active grifters. It's a sad sign of our culture that these people make a living this way.
I think all of our assets will end up in India to a dead guy!
I once got flowers from a girl... idk why but it just feels good
Kinda weird after you find out he wrote those songs while thinking about underage girls.
> he might not have seen the truth by the time he had posted the video That's kinda the *whole fucking problem.* Fake Motherfucking News
The worst Alabama loss under [NAME]. It was a good day.
Well with the inclusion of run counters shit seems pretty pretty brain dead to me.
Wow I never noticed that either before you pointed it out
He’s not the brilliant tactician he’s made out to be.
A 20% win percentage really sneaks up on ya :( no wonder this sub has to have a toxicity talk lmfao
I would have liked this period to go differently.
"Who the hell thought he was dead, seriously."
You can do it but it won’t be easy or fast keep watching craigslist.
"Don't worry, I'll sacrifice myself. Hey u/hellseashell, come over here. wants to call you a piece of shit."
Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions.
"It’s always entertaining watching people in the background semi-dance, while being painfully aware that they’re on camera"
That sounds terrifying. I hope you and the little one are OK.
"We had a clown banging on dorm windows, on campus, with a knife in 2016. Was terrifying. "
"Slap her hand if she is trying to force you to do anything! Tell her not to put her hands on you, and enforce it every time. "
I'm painfully aware of that having bought a FreeSync monitor with my Nvidia graphics card.
I had smoothies in the past with these packets. Solid as fuck. Dragonfruit one too.
Are you sincerely saying that [NAME] are bad because they were in the minority?
Fake The monkey was a paid actor!
Going to get hard for everyone after brexit
I would love to see [NAME] play all 60 minutes but nah. [NAME] needs to chill.
It's riskier to take on bad contracts right now
Well if he takes his daughter to a nightclub then that’s a bit inappropriate
She had a reality show that actually showed her in the act doing horrible stuff
Running with a gun and a sensor dart out makes me feel so cool.
I've shit my pants walking home from school. Hour long+ walk
"It’s a fucking rockstar videogame, not an old west farm and hunting simulator you pleb."
"What should be the campaign is telling people that just because you find a child beautiful/pretty, it doesn't mean you're sexually attracted. "
I’d go at [NAME] every possession. He is so tired out there
Oh wow. Except gillette i haven't used aby P&G products in years
Yes.... because they are dictatorships.... capitalist america is ending bad too if you pay attention.
This would be completely ludicrous. Turkey can literally just drive tanks over these guys if they want.
"Really didn't like. I thought it was nasty and mean-spirited. ""[NAME]"" on ice it isn't."
Your video fails to show how though?
"Yeah, my mom would tell at and hit our family dog. She was a tiny little dog too. :("
In the least condescending way possible I think you have some gross misconceptions and I'd like to clear them up.
"I've spent too much of my life being angry at the Jets, just gotta roll with it now."
We got nowhere with that because you only drop one-liners and refuse to actually engage.
"Somebody should make this a smaller video to share it around, this poor kid is going through a lot."
WHO WAS DRAAAAAAGED DOOOOOOOWN BYYY THE STOOOOOONE
"Losing my Origin account? Oh no, how else will I play thousands of other non-shitty EA games now?"
"Damn never heard of that, I stand corrected!"
Well someone took Freaky Friday to #10...
How is this news? I am sure there are a few living in discovery park and along the coast there
Forgive me for being so forward but you’re hot af
"okay, enjoy living in ignorance and hatred"
This is like that SNL sketch. EDIT: For anyone wondering what I’m talking about.
I think it it would have been even worse if that was the case
What's her name? I'm wondering if since it's being posted now years later Reddit might do it's thing and solve some crimes.
Her absence is probably the greatest present she can give you. Enjoy it while you can.
I'm honestly surprised you haven't been banned yet.
"Have faith, I'm sure there is enough fan support for more popular characters to be brought back. "
"you could do that but i woulndt want that as soldier, widow or mccree. but of course reaper should not try to break the shield"
After the first sentence you were my best friend. Then came the second sentence and now I really don’t like you.
I didn’t even realize it says it right there. Sorry
Except forming an opinion of a topic without even having basic knowledge of said topic makes you sound pretty arrogant and entirely undercuts your opinion.
Impact? I'm merely interested in how low you will sink.
It's cool and fun and a nice change of pace but I want my hidden blades back next game.
I dont like american music cuz south korea has the best dancers?
The weirdest part of this is how good he is at singing
I keep hearing [NAME] is a terrible hire.
They have directly targeted civilians. It's disgusting.
Good luck bro! I am with you on this journey. Currently on day 7. I had trouble sleeping yesterday night due to the urges.
"Well, he promised [NAME] it was over and he was out for good, right. So, no."
I dont think all of us do. However I think the ones who actually do are unfortunately the loudest.
Are you saying that's why they went with [NAME]? That's racist
Going to my favorite greasy burger place in Madison tonight to celebrate my ability to eat delicious burgers whenever I want because I'm in my early 20's
Im fine with complaining. A little surprised he's complaining without playing or even reading the patch notes since they were released.
"Nope, not a [NAME] fan at all."
hahahahahahahahaha that post history oh [NAME] mods please dont delete this its too good
That fact that sub has so many subscribers hahahahaha
If you like that I got one that you may like. makes me laugh everytime here
Did you know the origin the first time? I don’t find it very funny in the absence of knowing that.
I loved this look and it was good but this comment..
HELL YEAH!!! And in only 7 months?? That’s such an achievement!
Bitch subscribed to 1st look at [NAME] shitposts.
I know it's so amazing. Too bad all the people that hate the game haven't thought of giving it a try.
"No offense, but you are jumping in conclusions that may be as incorrect as blaming [NAME]. "
"Weird, I checked again and it works for me now. It wasn't the first few times I tried to click."
"Fake news! Obviously this can't be true, as everyone can clearly see the angelic halo above [NAME] head. "
"Not an unattractive man, he’s gonna need real plastic surgery to fix that. "
"I sould have assissted in the stabbing, even ceasar would have been surprised by the amount of stab wounds on that little shit"
Tear all of it down - that place is such a horrific example of trash civil engineering
Combination of lapses in defense and the continuing saga of the Sabres' god awful PP.
It's a prime-time soap. I feel so guilty.
Happy late birthday :) I hope you got to spend it with someone/doing something that makes you feel happy and whole.
"Right. It was wasted screen time. But oh no, we couldn’t have a Snoke flash back that was 30 seconds *at most*."
[NAME] doesn’t roll his ankle on a 🎾 in 2011 and we win a premiership imo
"This is profoundly unsettling to me for some reason. Thanks, I hate it "
i managed to craft that super early in the game and i was so disappointed that i basically could not get drunk
Not admitting you like something because some of the fan base sucks is pretty pathetic.
Shittiest crowd weve got this season omg please stay home an empty arena would of been better than this shitshow tabarnack
damnnn wendell. just willed that one in
I'm really happy he and [NAME] are finding success
I like it! I think the ideas of [NAME] can go a long way. I wish you the best of luck :)
that sounds absolutely adorable!! im glad you had those kittens there as a distraction :)
Id rather have native tribes have the opportunities than big business. And we really don't need anymore casinos anyways. Edit: in my opinion
The Birds is probably not quite what you are expecting.
That's odd. Where I live it all the disapproval has been silent. The loud people are older cougar ladies that are into that kind of thing.
It always makes me super happy when I see stuff like this. Go live your best life girl!
That's sad. You can be acquaintances with women. Not like you are driving them to the nail salon or something .
"Eh, loser. It’s sad how some people don’t care about their relatives."
That dog was so happy I thought he was gonna start flying like tails the fox in sonic
Same reaction I had last week when I learned that [NAME] was once engaged to [NAME].
Could you imagine? That would be so terrible for viewers. 😂
On-court obnoxiousness should be punished and has nothing to do with the game of playing tennis. Bring your A game hitting the ball or walk off the field.
"That's very disturbing to be honest, casually admitting you'd turn to cannibalism...? Ehhh"
Can’t believe [NAME] era is coming to an end... feels like yesterday I saw his 1st win against the cowboys with tiki breaking the rushing record.
This is why I clean my belly button every day. That’s disgusting
Not gonna lie I’m against offensive chants don’t @ me. I think they are unnecessary and a detriment to the O calling a play
"Damn democrats, if they think they're caring for the children, why don't they just change the weather then, never thought about that one. "
Thanks I was worried that I might die alone
The sea was angry that day my friends...
"Blow me you feckless moron, I was out of state. "
He was a bony old bastard and probably jealous of their big cat energy.
Enjoy trading a potential superstar for the worst guard defender in the league.
"First of all, no. Second of all, she probable is still in love with you "
"If anything makes me belive someone DOESN'T get laid, it's comments like this."
No is just apologize and explain the situation
Reading some of the stories on this sub make me appreciate my family more.
I will never understand why streaming is entertaining.
Never will happen because of abortion legality. Party/religion over country
Could also be an overwhelming guilt in the heat of the moment. Probably hard to stay rational when you realize you've killed your own friend on accident.
I could not imagine being that imprisoned by my body.
It took a surprisingly long time for this to be seen by me on this sub.
It's such a shame that the game forces you to use the q-tip and prevents you from equipping any other weapon.
14 and im quite good at makeupmaxxing and tall so people (especially adults) always tell me i look 16-25 :(
"I want to know them - so I can actually murder them. (With words, that is.)"
"[NAME] and [NAME] may be stronger, but [NAME] just gone mad. She's lost the plot for sure."
I’m wondering the same; something seems weird about that interpretation of the law
I’m always reminded by my relatives on my birthday asking me if I have a girlfriend yet. Sorry bro ima yeet out of the social norm.
If they’re not gonna get anyone else with that money then I wouldn’t have minded
"Hey it's been 2 weeks, are your friends still stuck at 60-ish ranks, just gathering info on MM and such."
Couldn't sit through it. Was so bored. Skipped through parts and ended up feeling like I didn't miss anything anyway.
We can't let the 8 year olds who are playing an M rated game see all of this bad language!!
People back then just might have had a bad memory and kept forgetting about it.
I wish I could get the entire interview but it's from a SiriusXM Radio Show
Wow! You must have pretty low standards for teachers in your state/school! I guess that's why Massachusetts is always first for education.
I usually see tweets like this for girls but it feels nice to have it directed at boys
When you can see the redzone interception coming 5 seconds before it was thrown.
So many of [NAME] haters dismiss his top 10 stat placement. Never understood that.
"If someone has tithed 10% their entire life, fuck off with requests like this."
What the hell are you talking about?
Its mr. Clean your room. This guys pretty whatever but comments from people who love him read like copy pasta
Are you serious? Open up a fucking history book
Cheers brother. That’s very interesting. First time I’ve seen that article.
Why the hell do we sit trae in crunch time we probably won't win. Give him the XP. Very frustrating.
Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.
Omg so short but such a bop! I’m so excited for her album
Also convicted of rape. Interesting quote given that context.
"Bah gawd, she is broken in half!"
Didnt even know that was a thing.. yeah well ill probably never be a public figure so it doesnt really matter i guess lol
hey that's my weather give it back -- a north dakota redditor
It's bad enough when the Jocasta syndrome is one-sided. This is a pile of yikes.
Wtf if this is true it’s the funniest thing I’ve read all day.
Kinda sad to laugh at people who really need serious help.
I often do this when I listen to metal. It helps vent some of the anger I feel.
The real tips are always in the comments :D
It still cracks me up when people call me [NAME].
"No i know, was pointing it out for humor, not for any sort of accusation"
"thanks mate! I haven’t given that idea much thought, i’ll give it a shot next time i’m home"
That's just sad if it's for a game
> [NAME]. You disgust me. But seriously when do we get a real show and skip the constant ad teases.
I don’t think we want some sort of incest plot arising here
"Hope you don't touch the menus, they're the filthiest thing in any restaurant. "
I'm so sorry! I hope you are doing better!
Thanks so much for this pic! It’s even funnier the third time in ten minutes it’s posted here.
I always flew out from Edinburgh. First time flying out from Glasgow and I was shocked at how small and... dingy it felt in comparison.
Really? Cuz hella 18 year olds with bad grades from my high school seemed to do it with ease.
She got the gift that keeps on giving
People who eat themselves to death are mentally ill in my opinion. Homicide is a deliberate and unlawful killing of a person by another person.
"The username makes it even better, sucking a dudes toes, who is [NAME]. Man I'm jealous "
The real joke is your grades dude
*losing hope Loose is what your mom is
So can relate. Hot to the point I hated feeling good because it wouldn't last. Might as well enjoy the moment!
The cruise boat one (similar) where the water goes WELL over the porthole scares the everloving shit out of me every time
Thanks man! That feels good to hear. I’m glad someone is on my side and finally understanding how I feel about this season.😄👍
If he was a human being he wouldn't have subjected me to that song damn near constantly for a year.
I was surprised to see [NAME] towing the line on his show.
"except this isn’t true, we know this because other cities do the same thing and see no significant decrease in sales "
Well 216 is out now and Im crying. [NAME] why?
Sounds like a good deal to me. Where do I sign?
"Yikes. That’s straight up paranoid, you can tell they were looking through comments for someone to rage at. "
I wish it'd stop being submitted on the sub. We're out on him and it's pretty obvious.
If it's true i'm sad he's leaving but I wish him nothing but the best.
"Sorry, I was misinformed. My apologies, brother in [NAME]."
Yea we’re actually pretty efficient on offense considering our personnel. Way better than I expected. The defense is just historically bad
Wow... Mid 2000's this would of been a way better follow up to Space Jam and probably just as if not more popular.
i thought it was very coincidental that i was listening to 808’s while doing this bullshit and that this question popped up unexpectedly. made me smile
I wondered where the quote about “supporting your azz” and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.
This draft is one man deep tbh. Not getting Zion would be devastating and a waste of a whole year.
The important thing is that you're having fun
*6 objectively [NAME] and [NAME] are terrible at their jobs.
Is the Queen movie bad? That makes me sad. I'm still watch it anyway.
So creepy. Made me check my locks.
"OMG, is this the one that wore white? 😳"
I actually got offered way more pay to stay but no amount of money is worth my mental health. Woot for new beginnings!
I'm still insisting he is not her dad...
Went on a date with a guy getting paid to do a study that took brain scans while he was tripping on acid
r/music still defended him knowing that. It feels like almost everyone on Reddit wants to bang a teenager and they get mad when people say it's weird.
You cant love this girl if she already has a GF whom she sounds like she loves. You'll just ruin a relationship
I can't believe he told that story. I'm sure the minister that released the water is now so totally regretting not asking for a bj!
"In case you're wondering, Nintendo does put a bittering agent in their Switch cartridges...and it tastes horrible. "
I am removing this post because of sourcing. Read the sidebar.
"No, what’s sad is saying the same message like it’s news. He’s a copy paste machine. No original thought."
"Yeah, people die in civil wars. Stop.acting like the [NAME] are just killing [NAME] while spouting made up numbers"
Looks kinda creepy when you keep watching
So you stay on your theft from auto waiting for them to dispatch the next shift to the backlog of calls.
"Genitals in general are just kinda creepy, fleshy bits."
"ah gotcha, you zoomed in a lot further than i expected."
It's a shitty made shirt but if it was done well I'd wear it.
unfortunately there is no start over button. this is our one wonderful wild life.
"I live in Suiderstrand, which is past Aghulas, no option for fibre here unfortunately :("
There's an Arby's/Long John Silvers near where I live. I'm glad they don't cross menu items.
"Mono Red is probably the best counter to Mono Blue, but it is unfavored vs Ramp and that probably makes it a bad choice."
And? Did i say they didnt? Read the whole thread you bimbo
I hate watching [NAME] play I can tell before he steps over half when he’s gunna shoot or pass. His BB IQ is atrocious
"I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill 'em all!"
Yous offered the guy a contract and he rejected you. Probably couldn’t afford him lol
Had such a hard time cutting up the steak
"1, you,, you,, actually shat on a hamster? 2. Washing your hamster can kill it 3. You fucking shat on your hamster"
Cat puke. After a chocolate sundae. Idk. Looks horrid
I once got one missing half a wafer. So delicious.
Don't use autism as an excuse to be an asshole
Thanks :).. My issue got solved :) . YT on Twitter never helps.. they just do the basic troubleshooting.
Its weird because I didn’t say “house cat” I just said “cat” yet you felt the need to correct me.
I just checked and do see a lot of posts that are not humble brags.
This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Take my upvote.
Anyone who fell for the Lonzo hype from the beginning should slap themselves.
"That's not correct. The ""Dallas-Fort Worth, TX-OK Combined Statistical Area"" includes Durant, as it does Athens. "
I hope you enjoy endless mosquitoes as the climate warms.

"I’m rooting so hard for [NAME]. You can do it, [NAME]!"
the fact that [NAME] still exists is somehow the strangest thing about this

It's bad when that sounds tasty to me
"Got the same pops! [NAME] a lot :) too bad I can barely play him, wish there was a Hwoarang pop"
"It is really boring. There is a culture in church, but it is essentially soulless and is really only weirdness with a heaping of superiority complex."
Same reaction I had last week when I learned that [NAME] was once engaged to [NAME].
I still can't believe those guys got nominated.
I was expecting the clip from Home Alone that [NAME] uses to scare the burglars (I think it's from Angels With Filthy Souls).

People who mindlessly defend Turkey and Ergodan are very delusional!
Can we please just call out defense next year the Legion or Doom. The LOD just sounds incredible
"It was a very faithful remake, though. They just crashed the plane without planning out what to do next."
That proposed sub name took me way too long to figure out .
Honestly this type of support sounds very shallow. It’s not like you’re gonna support women in any way when their babies are born.
Aw it’s the same user who was scared of breast feeding lmao
Which means it isnt his fault? And the 4th? What the fuck was he supposed to do. stop blaming 1 player.
I'm glad that yours is getting slightly better too! Keep on working on it and you'll be a social butterfly someday!
You missed the chance to title it [NAME] :(
Please post any news you may find about her fate. This is so sad and so wrong. We need to know what happens to her.
Yep. Been there. Watching my baby crying while vomiting and her eyes looking at me so hurt was hard.

I’m tired of these stupid posts. Stop trying to become a meme. You’re ruining this sub!
OHH this is what Reddit finds ridiculous about this situation.
The original Halloween movie is still the scariest film I have ever seen. Being chased by [NAME] in this game is terrifying.
ROFL! Just about! Didn’t know someone’s eyes could bug out of their head like that outside of cartoons. ;-)
Welp these were my happy tears of the days. :’)
"I hate to be that guy, but there are 6’0” + women"

I can shit on [NAME] and [NAME] as well if you'd like ;) Viva [NAME]
It's amazing the people here supporting the [RELIGION] church and the child molesters over duterte... I wonder why.
I'm not a jealous person. That's not an emotion that comes naturally to me. I wouldn't try to cultivate it or maintain it.
Which is why I'm glad he turn around as he did. xD Still is both scary and funny if you look at it from a different light

Are you fucking serious? That’s a foul??
There were a surprising amount of surprised pikachus in this thread—thanks for the edit all the same.
You fool you're using logic on a show that is clearly not bound by any

"Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop being greedy!"
I wasn't digging it and then [NAME] did her spiritual spacewalk. I almost walked out.

This is the worst take I have ever heard on cooking ever.

Or maybe you could just learn the match up since they already gutted him in the last patch.
"Grew up watching avatar and [NAME] is one of my favorite video game protagonists, especially when RDR2 came out. "
>it tasted horrible to use. Eating some of that right now. No regrets.
It’s not satisfying at all. If this wasn’t [NAME] it wouldn’t be popular. Interesting timing considering the [NAME] debacle too.

"Is that Riverside, CA? That’s where I’m from! Sadly I was barely a teen in 1993-first time I saw them was Dec. 1996"
"Ooof, I’m so sorry, that is rough."

Canucks get a mind-numbing penalty called on them and the other team scores on the ensuing PP. Surprising nobody.
So this is what edging feels like

No one has the stinky pinky when everyone has the stinky pinky.
It means less when you hear words come out of her foul mouth. Almost incomprehensible.
I’m not saying he won’t ever recover. My point is he isn’t wrestling at Wrestlemania.

Oh so that’s what you are into huh?
I would not bother. He read your message and did not reply yet. So that's already a bad sign and not a good start.
Far more to do with being entirely irresponsible and dumb than anything related to benefits or tax claims.
[NAME] is unbearable. I wish [NAME] had killed her.
Lol not gonna happen. He is just in love with [NAME]. He fell in love with her when she gave him the hand of the Queen.

"You are not alone. We do not sit in this darkness alone, even though other lack of light may make it seem so. "

Given [NAME] was in charge of the transition I don't see how he kept his hands clean. I think if [NAME] goes down so does he.
Why hasn't he been made GM yet???
I wish I could give it to you. I've always had negative comments.
I do not trust our defense at all. I do not believe you can increase the range of Andujar.

He might be happy to discover that he is the father of someone with superpowers! LOL
"yea he had 6 assists which created 13 points, if he had 13 points and no assists people would be calling it a great game for him"
Your passion for [NAME] literally put a big smile on my face. Stay wavy!
"Doesnt matter where it happened, retail companys will find any excuse to throw their employies under the bus"
"Here we go, ya'll ready for WW3...this time we're the baddies! "
"I know he will be, I'm just nervous. His face is just going to be so sad 😢"
Sorry I kind of took it like you were flexing on my or my opponents skill or something lmao
Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.

There was no need to crap on this guys feelings but you decided to anyway. At least you did the right thing a helped him dodge a bullet.
after that we had no sustained damage for the fight so [NAME] and [NAME] just killed [NAME]
The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from this is astounding
"Sorry, no trivia today. Calendar had a fun fact which I'll edit this post with when I get back to it"

"I don’t know, I think we all just blunder through. "
"That is the issue with most things, if you work there you can not win, as well as friends and family members."
Whiskey isn't going to help. She should pray to [NAME] that another man comes and brings purpose to her life.
"They’ve changed their mind so clearly they would change their position when scrutinised. Like you said though, he was ignored. "
The ruling class doesn't care. Their only goal is to plunder and loot the country for their own financial gain.

Just learn from this and move on bro. Give yourself time to mourn.
I will lose my shit on you if you eat in my car. I don’t do it so why the fuck do you think you can?
the problem is that it's arbitrary. USA already has too high standards for immigration
In foreign policy terms we're no better than Russia. We're guilty of everything they are.
Wow. Yeah does your place autograt at 8 or more ? So sorry 😐
How i wish i was there rn.
We will never survive with 5% unemployment with moderate growth and a continued house building program to correct supply. Sounds horrendous

Dirty secret. They retired the decks until they got a doozy.
"[NAME] should be sticking that to the other side of the keeper, strange decision to go for that corner"
Poor Guy. Come back stronger than ever!
"Dammit, [NAME]! You're only hurting hardworking doggos with this shutdown!"
My son brings *homework* from kindergarten. I feel betrayed.
Today on someone flamed me in chat
The dense stuff isn't very accessible. :/
Is that even legal? Isn’t that signing under false pretences?
Not actually cheating if the system is set up that way. Take it up with your Government.
[NAME] is the worst coach in bulls history
This is fantastic and I'm happy for her!
Throwback to [NAME] tweeting about how bad it was that [NAME] was in a punk band in college
for a moment i got scared and wondered what was this doing here then i read the happy ending
It was shocking to me when I realized this! Best of luck on your journey!
I am so sorry. My kids are the only thing keeping me going. The loneliness is agony.
I don’t believe it is part of my credential program. I am going through the IMPACT Program of San Joaquin County Dep of Ed.
Did the same thing more than 20 years ago and I still think about it periodically. Brutal.
"Regardless, fight 'em every inch of the way like it's the last hill to die on. Complacency is complicity. "

Is your brother incel? Is your dad upset you came out ugly?
hahaha. I was/am honestly surprised that is the only time I've heard of a parent calling a rapid.

Sometimes a guy just wants to unwind and get nose deep in some chocolate starfish man
"I wouldn't volunteer a second honestly. That weather is not worth it, and neither are your coworkers."
This has to be made as a satire of terrible memes . Like r/okbuddyretard material
Poor kid. He just wanted to rescue his mum from a nefarious organisation. I hope he gets decent representation.
"Get em chief, fuck em, I find those people annoying as hell and I barely even use Instagram/twitter"
I'm so sorry. She's a very lucky cat to have people who love her so much.
I think it should be a felony. Kind of crazy that illegally entering a country is such a minimal offense.
"Well, its been hours and I was correct. The OPs comment was totally 100% incorrect. Have a great day, thanks for playing. LMAO!"
"The problem they have is... They ""knew"" [NAME] would win."
What the hell happened today? There must have been a pretty major disagreement.
Reminds me of this stunt [NAME] pulled a few years ago in
Stop the algorithm 😂😂 Like she’s living in the matrix or something!
"You did nothing wrong. I really encourage you to look into emotional abuse and manipulation, as it sounds like you're on the receiving end."
[NAME] has to have a shot. Tough son of a bitch. Also [NAME] = [NAME].
"Ah, alt right thinking. Afraid of people who have anything 'upstairs,' or 'between their ears.'"
I'm just glad we'll be getting either [NAME] or [NAME]. They both seem like they'll be beasts and it'll fill our greatest position of need
"You thought wrong. Also, the answer is Caribbean Splash Car Wash on Clarksville Pike. I'm not even kidding."
At least she didn't hot glue it
That was jarring indeed. But why he wearing a mask?!?!?!
"> we get a minimum of $11 Wow that's pretty generous, no wonder people don't need to tip."
Happy New Year to all my fellow Asuka mains and all you dirty bastards who show no hespect. Cheers!
"I love my kids. I don't always like my kids, but I love them. "
That creepy realization that everything [NAME] says is projection...
That’s one of the many sleeping cycles of my fucked-up schedule :)
The hardest part is trying to figure out what anyone is talking about with all these F degrees.
That was what was most nauseating for me honestly. Not a single period used once.
Arizona in the summer is fine. Arizona in the winter when all the blue hair snowbirds come is absolutely horrifying.
All of troomtroom videos on YouTube are this odd and unnecessary. Some even more so. And their thumbnails are interesting
So many of Pokimane’s fans are creepy 30+ year olds. I feel so bad for her.
Yes! Im glad you see where he got that n-word take from 😂😂
Fair enough but I would imagine it's a small enough number that we can deal with. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater...pun intended
That’s crazy! Really bizarre. Is she off reddit too? I did notice fewer posts.
So you're saying there's a chance I'm a bot... I don't even know what's real anymore!
We still ended up with [NAME] at the draft though.
"No, she's standing in the water after she pees."
This is horrible... One of my worst nightmares actually.
"Yeah, turns out there are some SNEAKY Grizzlys there that can surprise even a dog."
Explaining the whole thing i wouldnt have the heart to physically or mebtally hurt a person such as raping someone
I'll be rather upset if he scores against us
It's almost like the whole rationalist thing was started by an overconfident person.
Here in the UK I’m pretty sure I’ve never seen a taco
"It sucks being unattractive. It pisses me off that there are so many beautiful people in the world, and I ain't one of them."
I'm saying your question is irrelevant to the post's topic. Stop being passive aggressive.
I am worried about [NAME]. I really hope that his elbow is alright.
"Dammit, you know I proof read this and I thought it changed correctly but I guess it didn't."
Probably. The fact his reaction to you being injured was to go off and have sex with a stranger is not a healthy sign.
"I am so thrilled that you broke through that constraining ceiling, or that ""tunnel vision""."
"No, you're supposed to get angry and yell that you're right when someone corrects you"
"No, but I might choose to not support certain teams because their owners are trash."
I was just a little disappointed that there is no audible/visible reaction by the character when visiting the graves (also trying to avoid spoilers).
"What? They all look entirely different. Yes, they are all handsome, masculine men, but that's it."
I feel terrible for their daughter. I wouldnt want to grow up in between the middle of that.
"I just don't want to see them shame themselves, and actually show their worth and virtue instead of showing themsleves to be a walking sexual object"
"Hate that scene? Believe it or not, jail. "
Do you mean addons exclusive to him? The instasaw bubba is pretty fucking good....
I was expecting this to go MUCH worse than it did and I’m so glad my imagination wasn’t right.
"That is patently false, considering his history of driving multiple businesses into the ground."
Being a broke college student doesn’t help😂 thank you for taking the time to listen though it’s really helpful lol
The sad thing is that most of them are gone the next election anyway.
I didn’t know it was gonna be that simple Forgive me [NAME] :D
Wow it's almost as if those losers have a lot of money or something else to leech off of.
"While I understand where you are coming from, this is a tad too aggressive."
In the comments he accuses the account of being fake and she proves her identity with photos and a link to her instagram. This guy is astoundingly pathetic.
She got the death penalty...? fck me.
"Can I just say that the Elizabeth Line is still a bloody stupid name, and no I don't think I'll just get used to it."
Reality i could force people to have sex with me Im 14 btw
"Considering the role of hypergamy, men and women being on equal footing actually makes things harder for most men."
Also op I have my associates on top of my bachelors? Whatchu mean
Boring way to get it and unfair with the rest of the pkayers
"Very true thank you for the insight, this does help as I need to remind myself this is a new relationship and part of our reconciliation."
I really hate this jersey and it just doesn't seem like a Sabres logo despite being the most accurate to the name of the team.
"I love this so much, glad [NAME] made it to San Jose after all"
Me too! They were half off at the grocery store and people love ‘em.
"[NAME] is so cute ^_^, the second bunny image is my favourite. Since you haven't got any requests... I request Himiko."
Sadly the same way know people who know people and being in public. Maybe an online game with chat like league or xbox
"Yes!!!! Great weekend. As others have said, I can now enjoy the rest of the playoffs"
" I didn't see any thinning spot. Again, it could very well just be the way his hair is cut this season. "
Wow. You basically found my dream woman and gave her up.
"Considering that the picture OP jerked was fake and that the OP of the faked picture was rude as fuck to absolutely EVERYONE, that’s completely false. "
>So that was a **fucking** lie. FTFY.
It's like an instinct for idiots to downvote without even reading a comment first if they sense the word vegan in it haha
We really need to sign a new CB now with [NAME] out injured. [NAME] isn't good enough yet.
"ASMR is a weird sexual fetish for incels, and dont let anyone try and convince you otherwise."
Players need to have Agency over their characters. you did not. total crap. :(
"This is going to end in absolute tears, the days of hoofball dominating the Championship are long gone, you actually need to play football to get anywhere."
so did that one guy outside of AT&T :)
Showering with someone feels more intimate than sex for me...and I don't like it.
"Unfortunately, we live in 21st century America, where this kind of behavior ensures that they will both be given high-paying jobs at CNN."
I will never be able to comprehend that beautiful flick into a headshot hanzos seem to do.
I like how the last picture is of [NAME] beaming smile and not even so much about the tattoo at all.
"[NAME] gets a lot of unfair criticism. [NAME], too"
I would have thrown them out sooner for all of the childish things they did.
maybe next time you should do some fucking research. prohormones will shut down your test production
"Sure you can, but the question is whether or not the kid will listen, or if you will upset the parent. "
I'd say Rick and Morty fans. I'm a fan of both but I feel that Rick and Morty fans take everything way more seriously.
What this guy said but with a little more cocaine and a drinking problem.
If she canf even protect herself what the fuck is she doing in a business that protects others.
its funny because they dont even do anything at the look out tower but stargaze
"Funny when I hear people claim a breed is dangerous, I automatically assume they are trash."
Yeah it's pretty odd how defensive some people are about my comment too
No matter which you pick ([NAME] or [NAME]) the dance and the date scenes were great. It genuinely makes me happy seeing [NAME] happy.
He must hate that gym as much as everyone else does.
things are simply wrong and ignorance is an insufficient defence from prosecution.
Cause as soon as he locked in execution he used the auto typing function immediately celebrating. Gets punished by karma and im the one down voted. Sure
"Fuck all those ""racist [NAME] supporters,"" amirite"
"I wouldn’t worry, most United fans have never even been to Manchester. "
That was the only place I saw and their pictures looked horrible. Might just have to go to the source and vacation in southern Asia
That sucks. But you can find another SO. You can't unhave a kid.
Every day it gets harder to tell the difference between a legit mental health issue and someone just using it as an excuse to be an arsehole.
I don't care about [NAME] story but I surprisingly found myself liking Bristol's.
"Haha, no. But probably just because I hadn't thought to do it."
I joined the casuals on the couch and curled up in horror while watching this
Hey I’m going to eli today! Unfortunately for a funeral but hello stranger :)
Agree on the last point. My INTP friend's ENFP is immature since she's still young. Gets jealous at every damn girl that approaches... Sigh
Exactly! Someone think of the billionaires! Sometimes I pretend I’m one and it’s really fun :)
What the fuck is [NAME] doing in the background
This is wonderful. Hope to have him and that newly a Dad joy back on ice as soon as he's ready.
How the fuck is that not ticketable.
I've never been so proud of humanity.
It's like muricans don't want to protect their own jobs and are happy to become low-wage dump and burn workers for the owning class.
I think you and I think alike. Sometimes I wish I knew less of history... because ignorance can be blissful
I like to think I do but idk my advice could be awful haha.
Bit of a clickbait title. He said it's normal for a big club to sack a manager that's lost a lot of points.
"What is the point of this app? Not much is given on their page on the app store other than ""fun"""
"Short answer, fuck no, don't ever fall for it. Don't make the same mistake Canada has."
It was shocking to me when I realized this! Best of luck on your journey!
just speculation at this point but it's not looking good
She is a horrible person and that is what makes her so relatable in real life.
"It's amazing how utterly lacking in self-awareness this sub is, that it can upvote this without a hint of irony."
Her elitism is what earned her the place here. She's clearly a lefty statist.
It certainly reeks of the same kind of scam.
I said none of those things. My awareness of a slang term and its means is just that. Understanding language.
The problem with crypto is typically when people have a bad feeling about something it rarely turns out well
U get an updoot from one sad person to another
This may be one of those 'pick your battles' situations. Him not paying tithing is HUGE. I would take that as a massive victory.
This is so cruel. I literally feel physically sick.
"My best friend waited 5+ years for her boyfriend in prison to come out. Two days before coming out, he dumped her."
"It’s lunacy to think that [NAME] is an actual Russian agent, since there’s literally no evidence of this."

I hate deer. Damn big assed rats
You'd be surprised how much control [NAME] has in your life. I've experienced it first hand. Mentally.

I hate people who can't *read* Dx

"If she deleted your Snapchat just because you showed up to a bingo, then it seems she's a bit of a bad person"
Cute but I dont like where this is going
I am really disappointed in everyone today. Not a single murmur was mentioned. People only murmur in [NAME] world.
"Surprised, Playtest isn't mentioned. The ending is just god damn!"
I would love to know why you think it's awful advice!
Just doesn't really work if the DM doesn't want it to...
Glad to see I'm not the only one with that bug. Maybe someone will report it some day.
Do you boo boo. Live your best life

[NAME] is letting [NAME] play 3 :0. That is good news.
A long term relationship with pizza? Wow talk about accurate!
I'm sorry [NAME]. I won't do it again.
"Thanks. I'm still sad till this day. But whatever happens, I'm at peace with his decision."
I’m not sure even know sits a fucking painter’s tool. I hate everything about everyone in this video.
Sweet. I can get by on beer. Cant sit through a comedy show without an adult beverage of some kind.
Those are hoteps. They're delusional idiots; no one takes them seriously.
He aged twenty years with that look.

And this is actually one of the nicer flats you can get in Boness too!
If New Jersey are going to win it in the winter they better get something done quickly..
Love the gif but I bloody hate these kinds of captions. It's as annoying and cringey as a fully grown adult doing baby-talk.
"I think they were talking about the learning proccess. [NAME] succeded as well. So, 3 of them."
Stranger than fiction. Can't even begin to comprehend what that poor [NAME] was going through.
My earliest memory is being in a wooden crib and my mom screaming in my face at the top of her lungs. It didnt end there.
I disagree. It's a couple of loud voices and some pretty blatant brigading from at least one of them.
Why'd I get downvoted? Am I not allowed to watch Spider-man?
Going to get hard for everyone after brexit
I like how the Red Tie Legion chose a picture where he’s tieless for their shitty-ass meme.

This must have been totally horrifying for you. I'm glad to hear you found peace in the second birth.
"Hey, I’ve learnt something here today, so thanks! "
It's the worst when it's something you are passionate about
Good to hear - I am glad you at least have that choice.
How dare you make an attempt to be kind!
2019 should just be a picture of a trash can or dumpster on fire. Amazing how shitty DICE can make things in 10 years.
I encountered a shark whilst hiking last year. He wasn’t the least bit interested.

Lovely places to buy from but very hard to get a good price as a seller because of their high rents (and bargaining expertise!)
They are. Primates (humans being the exception) dont hug like that when they're happy.
Refusing to pay someone for work that they've done is theft. You can try to justify it any way you want but that's what it is.

"Hell yea brother, Charlotsvile car attacker did nothing wrong Lets see how quick they scream hate speech"
I didn’t know it was gonna be that simple Forgive me [NAME] :D
For the record I don’t necessarily want him either. I just think he’s a compelling person.
"Yessir, it gives me the creeps. That boy ain't in Scotland, and that boy ain't right."
Some of us disagree with the socially constructed sexual binary concerning how we were assigned at birth.
Its to hard to write for [NAME]?
The saddest thing about this is that most people truly in need are the last ones to ask for help because they don't want to be anyones burden...
"Low life is as low life does. I wouldn't be too surprised if he's broke by the time he's middle aged, unfortunately."
It's weird because sometimes I care and sometimes I don't. Although I wouldn't call myself an asexual I could be leaning more towards demisexual.
1k followers on Twitter. Seem to have no sponsors. Not looking good

"That's just the adrenaline. It'll set in soon, haha"
Weird we’ve seen leftist harass and attack elder people and elder veterans but it doesn’t become mainstream news. I wonder why that is
This is so painfully 80s. I hate it.
r/UpLiftingNews Edit: I just got banned for posting this there.
I really hate this jersey and it just doesn't seem like a Sabres logo despite being the most accurate to the name of the team.
Only bet on games you like. Sometimes go a couple days without action. Betting just for the sake of staking something is never smart.
Sounds like a really bad time. Just wait till you have a nice time and place to trip.

"Unfortunately, this sub is slowly being populated by prequel revisionists and the good-ol-day guys. "
"I’m broke, dealing with my own mental illness, and immediately concerned with just keeping the peace."
He happily accepts the hugs. He hugs me now and again. He also has no problem accepting hugs from his mum.
"Man, I would gladly roast this one. Fat rich people must be tasty.."
It would feel amazing. Which would scare you. So you would crush it. Along with yourself.
She already had a child protection worker. It wasn’t her first rodeo sadly.
"I'm just gonna hit ""back"" now. See you guys."
Only [NAME] could claim that shutting down the thing he is in charge of is a success.
Honestly? No. I just feel sad for you guys
That was your saddest shortest story yet

Today on someone flamed me in chat
I actually want to die rn. I don't want to watch the SB but I know I'm going to.
I am glad I'm not the only person who noticed that bit of WTFuckery. 🤣
Because our roster has gotten worse each year since 2017 and the team is spending less. That isn't a recipe for continued success
[NAME] does not deserve to be with [NAME] just to be cleared. She forced herself and kissed him to prevent him from going to Zero Two.
"That isn't entirely fair. We're also for harboring regular ol' right trolls, too."
"> Still hard Phrasing. O_o Sorry, I couldn't resist."
Reminds me of [NAME] from the documentary THIN who purged food through a feeding tube in her stomach. This sounds dangerous.
"And he doesn’t even stop. It’s your work truck, man! They’re going to find out regardless. "
"Yes, amazing price! Everyone I told was completely shocked!"
Something is eating this poor redditor and I don’t think it’s the injustice of society at large to accept face tattoos.
When I drove refers I was always afraid this would happen to me. I always shut my doors I'm just a worrier
I am bored of [NAME]. Next celebrity chef!
[NAME] was half-blood but it wasn't a smart idea to bring up his father.

Call it whatever you want. I’m just clearing a meaning that many atheists aren’t aware of or don’t consider.
"I really enjoyed Fractured But Whole, but I don't remember the meals being significant (it's been like a year). Can you explain?"
Oh so we get to see [NAME] being a good kid. And then [NAME] tries to MURDER HIM. Makes sense.
She eats it until she throws up the first snows of the year. After that she just likes to play catch with it and roll in it.
Oh [NAME] all the cereal will be stuck soaking in milk until they get mushy and gross
"BREAKING NEWS, local bartender found chained up in drunks basement!"
How disgusting. Those vile people can burn in hell!

"I hated him too, just keep watching. Every character has their own personal journey which is such an admirable aspect of this show."
She looks like one of my exs always feels weird seeing her about

Ew yes I’m glad you brought that up.
"First of all, that's not true in any sense of the terms. Second of all, I'm not a national socialist lmao"
Fuck man I didn’t plan on crying in my cube today
">Is this battle the fate of the galaxy or not? If nobody else cares, why should we? Nailed it."
That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
A surprise to no one. Absolute stud.
Can you even hide the racism anymore or are we throwing all dog whistles in the trash?
that made me cry tears of sadness and joy at the same time.
Especially from the media that literally hates these players.
Our road still hasn’t been salted on Troy Hill

Upon reading I find this to be fake news and I'm disgusted to learn she writes for the age
Deep blue eyes look weird to me. The rest seems pretty good.
They don’t. Conservatives want to characterize any scoopy news organization as unreliable because they can’t get ahead of them easily.
Exactly why my money goes to more guns and ammo.
Lol I’m not a [NAME] bro. Sorry man.
Like [NAME] says you are overcoming an addiction and much like any other addiction in the wild you are suffering from withdrawl symptoms in a sense.
It's interesting that they don't know to take the handset off the hook before dialing.
Fuck Up would be more appropriate. Fuckin marketing wankers.
I'm sorry for your loss. From the picture it looks like he had a great life if that helps
Thank you for sharing this. May your friend rest easy and you find peace.

Looks like you don't have a story too.
"[NAME] passing is worse than usual. It's alright, but god damn is it painful to watch."
Glad to see Mrs. [NAME] is still alive and well!
"Ahh well if some rando in reddit says something without evidence, that’s good enough for me! International association of medical doctors be damned!"
"Yup, that's exactly what happened when the alt-right took over the sub. So glad I won't get banned for saying that now."
Surrender to the feeling of being seen as an idiot. It is the only way.

"Sadly too easy to gank. Bronze brawl 4-man notices you are split pushing, you are dead."
Hardly surprising. Now they also lost their coach... rip
That’s awesome news! Welcome to the family!
"They lead a bad defense though. And [NAME] isn’t blameless here, he’s not good against the run."
I agreed with your comment until you told people they shouldn’t be parents for not knowing the difference between deodorant and antiperspirant.
"The problem is your husband. If he prioritized you, he would have figured something out. I’m so sorry."

"This show has completely gone downhill, can’t believe I waited a month to be disappointed smh"
"you wear a headband, what are you a girl? /s"
There's a guy that died after he let a horse do that. He'd probably have survived if he sought medical attention sooner.

No.. that's the exact opposite of what they are.
"Hopefully created a monster. Also, I killed the morning at work."
I’m still waiting for a sick dunk from [NAME]

Recent Russian behavior is unacceptable...no doubt about it.

I would say ask him. Don't read into things too much. Just enjoy. You'll never know if you don't ask.
Sorry I thought you called me dumb. Long story. A misunderstanding. Sorry
I’m sorry about your pup. At least between the two of them she won’t be neglected? I just feel badly for you.
Cried when [NAME] and [NAME] gave each other a big hug and [NAME] lifted him off the ground.

It makes being ugly even more pathetic. All that work just to create suffering.
"This live meet the queens is awkward AF, I’d rather them produce this and make us watch nicely edited stuff."
good to see your story had a happy ending!

"Even today, many years later that still gives me chills. RIP."
"Oh no, the horror. Look, a pause! Let's start CPR! Those nurses, probably"
Somehow this hurt more than the Saturday game.
All the game modes are super fun
I can play faster. I just don't enjoy it as much. Might I ask what is your draft winrate?
"Oh wow, you are strong did you report him?"
Honestly- live your life as a person who can love what others hate- because that’s just a little more joy in your life versus their hate.
"That sounds like a hot date. ;) I've never been, but friends say just order the cheapest food and enjoy the ambiance."
"r/ThirdSentenceHappy My eyes swelled with tears as I opened the door and watched all 8 puppies, overcome with joy, as they were reunited with their Mother."

IIRC Tool doesn’t like their stuff on Spotify because they don’t like their business practices regarding royalties and such.
I wonder if this is why the universe keeps expanding. Because we're constantly filling it up with new words and new sentences.
I do remember this and wanted nothing more than to kill that guy
This made me smile. I watched it on YouTube.
Re-educated her is more like it. I feel so bad for her. Internally she must be a mess. I suspect she will change her stance again.

Odd to think that most people in this photo are either dead or just about into pension age.
"This is the first time I've finished something so cringey. I'm dead inside, thanks. "
You want to fix them. You can’t. This was a hard life lesson for me to learn. I also am a giant loser magnet.
"Turn off your phone, computer or even the internet. It is scary to do but just for now when the urges hits."
That it just seems worst now because we have phones (instant media)
"Glad you didn't add some awful ""Read that again."" in the description like I see other people doing when they retell this joke."

Oh shit why didn't I think of that?
[NAME] 12 min long? That other 1 min video spoiled me.

Nah dude it shows they aren't depressed adults but instead very cool kiddos.
"Even if you don't act on them, you still should stay away. It's not normal to fantasize about doing sexual things to children."

"When I was in high school, a girl told me I looked like [NAME] from The Little Mermaid. *Ouch*"
The funny/awful part is how well [NAME] works photoshopped in.

Gonna be sad when Gameday is inside a gym for shooty hoops. I already miss CFB :(

"The conversion go muscle probably helped, considering the size of them. I'm super happy for you dude, you've done amazingly!"

I would also have all this issues if I looked myself in the mirror dressing like that
Surprise! That fat woman you see on the bus every day is actually this generation's [NAME].
Glad to see I'm not the only one with that bug. Maybe someone will report it some day.

No response after a week? That's something to worry about.
That is not accurate based on the conversation i had with Mr. [NAME] today.

Wow so much younger but he sounds mature
I really love playing him and going against him. Legion is overall my favorite killer. I respect everyone hating him although I dont understand why.
No ENTP would be such a zealot about anything. This is STJ territory
But I think his feelings care about the fact that he's still not tall enough to ride any of the roller coasters at Disneyland
I think thats dumb and simplistic. You really can't boil down the sociology of race by comparing it to 2+2=4.

There is nothing more disgusting than those who put children in danger unless it is the people who allow them to do more harm.
I know it's Nightengale but he's saying upwards of 12/350.. ya no thanks.
It does make sense... I've always had a hard time opening up and I'm worried that that's what's really been holding me back ultimately
[NAME] was actually wrong all along. JAH > Jokic /s
Looks like your hormones are not working properly.
"I'm the first one, so that's wrong. Party affiliation =/= political leaning"

"She was sorry too, after I found out and ripped her a new one. LOL"
At least you can admit you value one innocent person's life over another. What a shock it's the rich politician over the security guard.
And there’s no reason to drop the f bomb when giving an argument
Flair checking in! I love it when they don't change the template messages!
"Well, at least she broke up first. It would somehow be worse if she kept it hidden and brought him the news later"

I tip my invisible hat anytime I drive past this dealership. What an unfortunate surname.

“Attack on masculinity” I’m dying over here you fragile motherfucker.
**WAIT THAT WAS A REAL STORY!?!?!? WHAT THE FUCK**
"Eh, you can't really judge his character solely on the appearances he makes on his GF's IG without making a ton of presumptions"
That's a lot of assumptions. My local post is exceedingly lazy.
Funny a lot of rich kids think 100k a year is very feasible.

It's been with me all day. Those reams of entries is one of the most quietly horrific things I've ever seen.
I used to love watching movie reviews and video essays. But it’s seems like I can’t enjoy anything anymore
I don't think we could afford the expense bill for coming out of a pretty cushy retirement.

The Button was amazingly fun. By far my favourite reddit memory.

"But once it's born, if its parents can't afford food, shelter and medical care, it can go fuck itself."
"In this case, I am really not so sure!"
I think they were just doing their job. Reporting what they saw. And yea that was the happiest I have seen [NAME]. Weird.

Um yea. You’re being creepy. Stop stalking her
"More like trash ass link. Wtf is “Apple Music”, probably some shitty limewire ripoff."

">the decades after WWII That includes 1950. If you want to insult me, read your own fucking post first"
I’m not arguing for it. I just think the punishment doesn’t fit the crime.
I read it on NRK as well. Brought tears to my eyes.
"You can't post a Sons pic and then say ""I got this"", that just hurts."
Yeah because what we should do is continue to be an absolute embarrassment.
"amendments are allowed on monday to mays deal, i'd be amazed if no one kills her deal"

Highly reccomend it OP Listen i got 74 days cigerette free i couldnt be happier! My next step is quitting the juul which is gonna be rough
People who eat themselves to death are mentally ill in my opinion. Homicide is a deliberate and unlawful killing of a person by another person.

Thank you! I'm so glad you liked it! I did finally get a new belt lol
Bein' separated just doesn't feel so right.
I don't think that makes you seem as cool as you think it does

"Aw, I missed it :( . I really need to spend more time outside of the roundtable thread..."
It won't matter how you explain it. He's cruel and insensitive and doesn't care about how you feel.

Six shots on goal for [NAME] and still nothing. This breaks my heart.
the negative connotation of eugenics is allowing dysgenics which is a far worse fate for humanity
The thing to understand about [NAME] is that he's a complete moron.
Sorry you had to live there. Good news is they are demolishing it in 2020.
"I'm so disappointed you didn't include [NAME] ""I'm standing under the source of the bull shit"" [NAME]"

I was raised solo parent so it was more of an angry hushed whisper when they thought I was in the other room.

I enjoyed that [NAME] kept saying [NAME] last name wrong over and over.
Can you apply to some kind of help within your university? Sorry this is happening to you.

Then he stabbed like five cops and hid in a haystack
She clearly was too afraid to speak up.
[NAME] you people are so fucking dumb

Gotcha. I see my clarification above. I sincerely apologize that anything I wrote made you feel that you needed to enforce your boundaries.
[NAME] is the most useless phantom thief change my mind
Right there with you. 20 years together and suddenly its over. I'm tired of crying and hurting. We'll get through this.

[NAME] this was hard to get through. Please crosspost to r/sadcringe
Self driving cars still won't help fix the problem if old people can't afford them
This should be the norm instead of the exception. Sadly the leaders in law enforcement are almost always more into politics than principles.
[NAME] why did they have to remove the OP? Her story is heartbreaking and she appears to only want some sort of comfort from the sub.
"Cool shot. Super wide angle, multi shot?"
I am having fun haha :D *creeper mode on* jk lol

you just use the word weird like that's all there is to it. weird isn't the issue. the issue is garbage
That is so sick. That kid will feel sooo awesome later in life. What doctor agreed to this though?
I can't remember a time during my early childhood where I didn't dress up like my mom and almost break my little ankles in her heels
That way you’ll get both food and laxative all in one. Sounds like a fair trade to me.
Glad we got that criminal off the streets! No-good [NAME]. Tsk tsk
Massive overlap. I have been vegan for 10 years and anti birth around the same time for the reasons you note.

That's a huge shame and says more about Sacks than it does anything else.
These stories make me glad that I have a job that doesn't require social interaction besides my boss and coworkers.
Don't fucking disrespect the World's Largest Love Machine ever again

I dont think anyone liked 6A apart from the two Slade episodes and the crossover. Most people here consider it to be sloppy
[NAME]! Get a DAMN good lawyer! Glad you're okay.
Kinda but it’s still a terrible meme

Thank you for this reply!! You actually made me feel a bit better about the whole thing now (:
I feel genuine sorrow for your family having to be associated with a cretin such as yourself
lol..You're not getting [NAME] or any of the young core..
Why? That's not helping us win games.
A thousand times this! I just found some of my old childhood stuff from the 80s with a 2 bar and it is fucking awesome.
nothing I dont owe anyone any explanation.
Unfortunately there are also far less/weaker unions now too
I haven't had class in three years and yet I've literally had this nightmare dozens of times.
OMG what??? ...[NAME] actually showed up for a gig without cancelling with a terrible excuse?
I have said many times [NAME] should just quit playing around and open a full on grocery store. Seems like a logical next step.
Pretty sure the legislature needs to change laws
"Yes, he needs to sit the fuck down, that's all I have to say."
"Not anymore, haven't heard of him in ages."
this has happened to me twice...most embarrassing shit
"honestly, individually he's been awful so far."
"Hey [NAME]! **TRY DRAWING TWO CARDS NOW, YOU STUPID FUCKING BASTARD!!**"
Lots of physical intimacy and sex almost every time we met. Never suspected that this would ever become a problem.
"None, I know nobody or have anyone nearby who can help."
[NAME] in the Lego movie? Get outta here
"I'd give them a first, but they have to retain salary. You know they'll just destroy that first round pick too."
Dude I remember liking [NAME] better. I don't get how kids can have crushes on other kids.
Yes! It's hard to believe that some people like warm toilet seats enough to pay for it as a feature.
"You're a bad person, but a great [NAME]."
"It would be mostly home-grown terrorism, angry at all the people fleeing from overseas terrorism."
Congrats!!! Thatll be me in May and I cant freaking wait!
"Yeah it’s pretty cringe tbh, I think he’s a good guy just a little insecure "
I always cry when [NAME] is on screen.
Try reading up. Not going to play these stupid games with a butt hurt Meltzer fan boy.
What the fuck is [NAME] doing in the background
"I have basically that print on a t-shirt, it's definitely coming out of the closet more often as soon as the campaign is official."
> is not needed for dogs. Wrong. In *this* case it wasn’t. It very often is.
I have trophy jeans and a trophy bra! Although RIP my boobs because they were the one thing I liked about my body back then :)
"[NAME] does seem a little high strung. Did you see him on [NAME] podcast? WOW. Still, cool dude."
"middle of lane is dumb that’s where all the oil pools, lane split seems like no one likes it but that’s more understandable"
but think of how fun it would be!!
"I couldn’t imagine putting a brand new car on these roads, let alone a Tesla."
Yeah cheers. Hoping it's gonna be better. Happy early new year to you too.
ahhhhh no how dare i have morals of course the most important thing is that my favorite football team has a better special teams coordinator
I was also bullied at work. I was on lithium for a while. You're not alone.
"If someone falsifies my medical records, I would say I've been harmed. "
[NAME] is really going to have to work his ass off to make this team.
Doesn't matter what we do. The announcers will trash the Wolves and praise the Lakers. I miss [NAME] and [NAME].
"I fall under left wing, so yup, I'm a soy boy."
"Manipulation. I love my mother btw, but this thing is insidious."
I was born in ‘98 so I feel like your ‘98 loss is my ‘09 loss.
That’s a new level of blonde I never knew existed!
But that rookie year was sick. Such a Slash fan when I was young.
"Being a bronco fan in NY, this podcast is the only radio I can consistently get"
"I hate the message that's being pushed, and it's even worse that it's being pushed by this guy."
Actually it's quite hard to decide without a proper reason. Under what circumstances do we have to do that?
[NAME] doesn't really look hindered by the way she's playing and hitting. I hope she doesn't retire. [NAME] just playing amazing.
"I have a feeling you're one of those far rightist trump supporters trying to use [NAME]. Your uncaring, almost sociopathic idealogies make me sick."
That is definitely an unpopular opinion. Upvoted.
"Nah, my comment stands. Poor effort. "
"SHE. IS. THE. FUCKING. WORST. P.S. You’re not fat, you just need a stylist. 🙄"
"Same, there was no thanks or consideration that they’d just given her the ‘night off’."
"I love that I’m smart, but not so smart that I’m socially awkward."
I’m surprised the comments and views on that channel haven’t gone crazy.
It just feels like everything is so false. If I can't care about myself why would anyone else.
“I am so sorry! That was not my intention at all. My apologies” so charming. They do give you warning though
yeah i guess being a sexually unsuccessful giant dweeb is being red pilled
"Did you hear about that old Italian chef? Sadly, he pasta way."
"So sounds like she was raped, and she seriously needs to press charges, this bartender needs to be raped in prison big time."
"as is tradition, guy who played for us scores against us to make us lose, third time in three months"
Its all good until that episode where [NAME] traps the bat on [NAME] head comes on and she screams bloody murder and wakes us up.
Nah mate hands across the M8 n that eh #gorgieloyal #bigcousins #watp /s
Fingerprints not [NAME] or [NAME] red is [NAME] don’t just make things up now that is sad !
I'm more surprised the dash cam was functioning properly. Usually around these incidents 3 of them were not recording and one had the lens cap on...
"When I looked at the picture, I thought for a moment that I was looking at a junk yard."
"This picture is a prime example that [NAME] are intolerant douchebags who will always demonize wealth, fame, and entertainment."
"I was reading up last night and it's a mixed bag. Exercise can help with the depressive episodes, but it can make the manic episodes worse."
Definitely didn’t give [NAME] a huge scar
"Congrats! Enjoy a free slice, I think you know what to do with this 🍕"
"If the cops don't let you win 30% of the time, stop asking them to play."
He’d be amazed i was alive and I’d have a super hot wife.
Fake news. Kids would be long dead by that age
"> your character is so yuck Thank you, for confirming my suspicions of who/what you are."
"[NAME] is lactose intolerant, so when it comes to milk he likes to drink soythress"
Maybe it's fantasy.....I just feel like the stock for a lot of these Ducks is reallllll low right now
"Whenever a new guy apologises for taking a while to back i just tell him it takes longer if he hits something, so no worries."
That feeling when your mascot is there but none of his players. Sorry Youppi
Omg [NAME]! One of my favorite bb players
"All of the wonder, beauty, and mystery of the world was taken before we even got here."
"Wife just had our baby, and this story freaked me out. I can't imagine going through something like that."
"if he would only have any marketable skills, alas I think he is going to serve hard time"
"Srs it's so bizarre! There's often someone like ""OP is wayyy prettier than [celebrity]!!!"" as well. "
You shouldn't be using hydrocortisone on your face:
I was able to just get in. I can swipe but can't see my matches or messages
"Why do people procreate, only to bring to earth a clone of themselves that's not attractive in any way. "
Go to Happiest Hour before/after the game. Walking distance b/w AA center. It's a fun spot!
"When you think milkshakes aren't decadent enough, now we have cakeshakes!"
Get back on your meds mate..You aren't funny at all...
Yes get [NAME] almost all the way the fuck out of here.
But those are typically quieter and then I won’t need them 🙃 are we done
its disgusting where our society is. free tube sites need to be banned
7 billion people doing things realtime is not to be underestimated
...and they're gone. Didn't even get to see what they cost.
Ye I never understood why they didn’t put that into the game
I can't imagine how scary that was for you. What is wrong with people?
WOW I love this photo so much! Is this recent?
Fuck pancreatic cancer. Kills so many and it barely gets any funding because all the money goes to shit like 'breast cancer awareness'.
"I could go, but honestly, it is the worst place on earth. I have 0 desire to do it."
There is no such Thing as [NAME] or an Almighty !
Might be an overestimate at this point.
Damn. It's hard to comprehend how massive the USA really is.
"Far enough, np. Its rough communicating sarcasm in text form, especially nowadays with Poe's law in overdrive. "
"That is absurd, man. I'm sorry you don't believe in the spirit realm. "
Is this because of the sudden spate of comments feeling shocked that we don't respect proud right leaners or have you always had these mails?
Pretty frustrating that when it matters most winning comes down to who cheats the most aggressively
I was just scrolling down and I screamed when I got to the feet
"This... This is where my journey ends. I was not able to make it to the end, good luck future redditors! "
"I don't, I think this is great. The more they disbelieve media, the more it hurts them."
"Grey socks and leather sandals, that hurts me through the screen."
100% feel for you. I may be exaggerating slightly but still it’s all these little disadvantages that we get put at because of this ping.
I was streaming on my laptop so I could watch the glorious win. Sadly hunting has been tough so far. Damn those Bison.
"Yeah, It's just difficult to resist the lure of the dark side."
"So just tell me I dont want to go look, was the video cut/edited? Or is it RAW? I MUST KNOW!"
These aren't [NAME]... they're [NAME] that like to pose in the form of a hexagram for some reason
"Yes, the Raptors need to stop committing dumb fouls."
I honestly believe that being a Saudi woman should automatically qualify you for refugee status.
Who could have thought that anti-semitism would have taken hold in feminism? Why would anyone think that animosity toward an entire group of people is welcome there?
Except shes not? I would date her.
That's cause [NAME] really got his career ruined by injury.
I genuinely think that would be an iconic shot if it was in a famous horror film. The way the legs just keep on coming is terrifying.
It's scenes like this that make me remember how truly special this show is.
The way that ladder is attached to the building is pretty terrible.
You're probably joking but [NAME] has been pretty insightful regarding the yellow vests in France. I was impressed.
"Sadly too easy to gank. Bronze brawl 4-man notices you are split pushing, you are dead."
It’s a smart move but also hurts the business and possibly false. It’s rude.
How unfortunate. You seem to have missed the point of being American in spite of everything.
"I hate the message that's being pushed, and it's even worse that it's being pushed by this guy."
Look up info on being an empath. I am one and am complete drained after outings even if I had a blast.
But also don't be so aloof that you don't want to help anyone.
"She'll ask them a question, interrupt them to say that something else is coming up and then talk about something irrelevant. She is all over the place."
Well someone took Freaky Friday to #10...
I’ve started the journal part! But I unfortunately need to wait until he gets more aggressive for them to act on it.
That 0.75 is not for the same job. It's looking at the totality of female salary vs male salary.
Yes. Some shows get canceled before they can even finish the season
"Goodness, that shot of McDonald's is **super** old. It looks like a picture from the 90s/early 2000s."
Of course it bothers you. She just admitted that something inconsequential to your relationship would be a dealbreaker.
"I love it. This made me smile so much, which is a big change from [NAME] which made me cry and further increase my depression."
I might be having carrot cake tonight!!! I love it! And that coffee sounds like the perfect pair! Enjoy it
Glad there's someone on here with a little sanity.
"You monster, I hate it. Well played."
"Yep California, I would've been surprised if they cleared him."
[NAME]’ ego has turned him into such a bully. He seems to get off lately on witch-hunting and encouraging his “sisters” to harass people.
Self confidence I think and the fact that I’m scared if I do give all of myself to some that they won’t reciprocate.
This thread is being brigaded by atheist/agnostics. They are just here to cause trouble. Look at OPs post history.
"Tool fan from the U.S. here. Something seems off about this question. Cheers, mate!"
B plug? What the hell. Use an A plug or you're never going to become doctor some day.
"It's a dumb and harmful thing, when you invite people because of their race and sexual orientation over qualifications and skill"
"Ah, [NAME] and his random crap again..."
Doesn’t frustrate me at all. He’s not worth the asking price. Plain and simple.
It is. You generally need 5 down and 5 up to play reliably. Also wired.
oh my [NAME] easily one of the worst sounds aaahhhhhh
You seem very angry. Maybe you should.... go jerk off.
That season 2 opener was great and completely unexpected.
"If many people truly see that as a consequence, I'd suggest SD's public [NAME] needs some work. Sad."
that was such a misstep from their PR. wtf were they thinking people were expecting with a public countdown
I am 33 and I still regret things I said in the 5th grade.
Probably wouldn't hurt to delete this post and pretend it never was posted.
"Oh cool, the new sign is up :) "
"No, I'm pointing to the fact that you think that without Capitalism, the only alternative reality is the Soviet Union."

It’s amazing what can happen if you work and want to win.
I'm surprised they've gone this long not knowing [NAME] swears a lot.
It's almost a shame we won't get a second leave/remain referendum because it would be fascinating to see the result.
"Ah sorry [NAME], I was going to join. But your desperate posts scared me away!"
Yeah until the last one has creepily wed and reproduced.
Rose coloured glasses get rosier as time goes by :) You'll move on eventually. Treasure the memory but be present in your current and future relationships.

the most romantic thing that can possibly happen to me
Just gotta day that age gap might have something to do with this. I bet he hates that dang rap music too.

"Yeah that’s a bit odd, wouldn’t be surprised to see that change come gametime unless [NAME] is shook or something."
Let me admit. This show is a guilty pleasure. Seeing these people's lives in such chaos brings me joy.
- But mom! I don’t wanna go to school today! - You’re going little shit.

I wanna hug my mom dead named me waking me up for school
I honestly have no idea what [NAME] offers Genuinely don't rate him
The only one to really be sad about losing is [NAME] tbh
An attractive woman falling down and exposing her butt. It's weird that he'd go so 0 to 60 on such a thing.
This is the saddest thing I've seen today
I don't like [NAME] but I'd never wish this fate to any parent.
I wish I could tell you if it was a good t.v. Let me just find the MOTHERFUCKING REMOTE!!!!!!!!
The worst is when those moments pop up randomly. Especially when you’re feeling happy and then a mistake you did back in 2005 comes creeping up.
I would enjoy this if it had a few more pixels.

These refs are [NAME] awful. Find a new job
"Frankly, partisan politics aside, I would REALLY like to know where this fever dream of historical came from. It's mind boggling."
I know they don’t want it. I just wish they did.
Yeah people used it as precedence. That’s very sad. What’s your point? What abhorrent treatment?
i like that she's just kind of meeting people and dating. I wouldn't even really call it a triangle tbh.
There is nothing more statist than socialized and compulsory education. They subsist on violence and perpetuate violence. These people are the clergy of the state.
NEXT TIME! ON THE CURSE OF OAK ISLAND!
One period? Damn you think it would last that long
Do you want to be promoted to Secreatary of State for the US?
Thank you! Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself otherwise you'll ended up in your late 30s exhausted and unhappy!
HELL YEAH!!! And in only 7 months?? That’s such an achievement!
Bisexuality does not and never has implied gender preference. Assuming that is perpetuating biphobia.
I have tried and succeeded. You’ve just had bad luck my friend.
I spent the entire time trying not to yell at the TV. [NAME] and [NAME] can fuck right off.
the most romantic thing that can possibly happen to me
Someone who evidently doesn’t really know much about football or doesn’t do a simple google search before posting.
"Grandmother got into an accident many years ago, and walked away with broken ribs.... it took her a couple years before she found out"
"They're wrong, it was due to their natural wetland habitats being degraded & drying out. "
After the first sentence you were my best friend. Then came the second sentence and now I really don’t like you.
"Happy 2019 to everyone except for Disney who plans to fill the year with crappy, money-grabbing sequels. "
"My problem was that Flashpoint ended in 1 episode, when it could've been an entire arc"
This is so true yet they usually dont listen.
"Yeah people demonize salt but like that's the opposite problem with restricting, salt is my friend leave me out of it"
This’ll get [NAME] pumped to come over!

"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. ""I don't want fucking unity with racists who put children in cages""."
"There. Are. No. Moderate. Republicans. Repeat this, nonstop, everytime she is mentioned. She is an extremist who pretends to be moderate."
"Bohemian Rhapsody is a horrible song. Really horrible. Queen had a lot of great songs, but that one wasn't one of them."
"Winnipeg Jets regularly have whiteouts, though I don't believe anyone paints themselves."
Every time [NAME] opens his mouth...he says the same damn thing.
We might now be almost maybe nearly ready to potentially maybe play finals. I think [NAME] will make the finals this year. They'll be the surprise team.
it's hurting my heart :( why did you leave me
"Go to switzerland, they'll give it to you. EDIT: Sorry, thought you meant sodium-pentobarbital."
0% But then again most of us on here aren't placing top 8 at majors so that could factor in
"Submissive? ""she’s a [NAME] so literally it’s like a brand new car [NAME] has blessed me with."" You're disgusting."
Why would you miss school because your dad is in the hospital? Plot hole like you read about.
I use one every time I park and you just replied to me. so this is a bit awkward.
Your husband isn’t at all worried about your reputation since he’s the one who spread the lie. Something to think about
I feel like the last two seasons made me detach from the show.
"""[NAME] H. MYSELF?! He's actually signing that?!"""
"I doubt people are *happy*, but they probably aren’t sad about someone who was potentially endangering others through their anti-science views."

"no it doesn't, hmmmm I sent in an ask on the discord support page about finding people so lemme check that"
My friend can't kiss her husband if he's had gluten and not washed his face.
Oh yeah lots of elitists who think they’re a damn gemologist but know nothing 😂
The only clown that make me laugh.
[NAME] being the most manipulative person in the house was not something I expected
"If I start shoving food into my face as I enjoy everyone here, dis becomes a bery bery unhealthly situation. "
"I just don’t like traversing through the snow, and how the salt stains some of my boots, and the mess it leaves at home."
Because physical contact promotes bonding. Healthy relationships increase both partner's wellbeing. Routine can be frustrating. Especially when you want to try something new.
"To show themself in public like that they never did grow up. A 11 year old in a 25 year old body. Sad, really."
Look we are starving but we still have some honor. We don't need any help from your people. Especially not 50 cents a day
I dropped him around week 6 and let somebody else deal with that headache
So glad to hear they got banned. Can't believe adults can still behave like that.
"Im sorry I was just trying to help, thank you for educating me ill do better, Happy New year!"
Another horror story - just getting on your train at the time it should have been arriving at the end destination 3 hours away.
Who needs sciences. It's most fake news they peddle in anyways...
One of the more disgusting virtue signals I've seen

Interesting I wasn't aware of this. Maybe proving the undue hardship is difficult but technically allowed? I wonder what counts.
From one eating disorder to another. That's not recovery that's just sad.
I watch it 4-5 times every time it comes up. I think there is something wrong with me...

"Thank you for writing this, for letting us into your world so that we can better understand our own. I am very grateful for this gift."
someones mad they lost the election FeelsGoodMan
NCAA is a poor barometer for scoring. [NAME] was leading scorer in all NCAA for like 3 years running. Not even sure he got drafted.
Kid looks like he's about to cry
Sadly enough I was thinking the same.

I’m so glad I have my own car

[NAME]! congratulations! and may [NAME] help you more!
"What about, hear me out now, 2max? It doesn't sound cool though. Could probably call it something else."
"Oh no. Your poor friend, I hope she can move past it someday. That has to be such a hard burden to carry."
Your video fails to show how though?
"Oh, what kind of material is for comedy cemetery? I never knew it was dif."
I'm sorry it happened like that for you. I really can't imagine.
"I was booing loud, so were a lotta others. That muthafuckah"
You left out information to serve your needs. How [NAME] of you.
She's been fired and shamed out of existence. Good riddance.
Puppies in 95% of cases. Sorry but some dogs are ugly no matter how old they are.
Just don't call me late for dinner.
"Then you realize it actually is the only way to feeling better, except having one or no friends make it tough."

The loading screen has the circle at the bottom that just keeps spinning. I tried uninstalling the app and that didn't work either.
No but that doesn’t mean people were less happy in the past.
Couldn't have happened to a nicer person.
[NAME] going to waste her virginity on that riff raff. My first time was with a married felon who lied the whole time. So romantic!
"I dont need Antidepressants, i need good friends"
Nothing more Jersey than the sound of car horns over [NAME] rambling out an annoyed answer to a caller.
Person #1: “well that was fun.” *turns around* “Guys...?”
"An indie rock guy I loved used dialectics to explain his songwriting process, it was weird."
[NAME] is not a smart man. Giving a fraud a fucking card. Like wtf
How I hate the black tarp on top...prevents the fan from blowing air in summer.
To be fair mumble rap is shite
Wow... never heard of that podcast. Looks awesome. Thanks for the link!
I'm sorry my Baby [NAME] joke made you so angry.
Poor [NAME] she just broke her back
Well it wasn’t opinion they didn’t like it was fact right?
"That’s a pretty high amount to pay per week over here, don’t know about the us though."
I don’t think I’ve ever seen that many downvotes.
*slams obvious repost on the desk* Pack your things. Get outta my subreddit
Nooooooooo I was a student staff member at the WCC and this makes me so sad and angryyyyy
I would watch that so hard. But I'm sure what's left of LuLaRoe and other MLMs will do whatever they can to stop it.
i don't really feel comfortable posting there. i dont really have much reason to
"I feel these people think, what you think you can just feel good? They always feel bad so should you."
"*insert [NAME] talnkig about how they will love you but they will hate you, but it's [NAME] instead of [NAME].*"
Don't let a few hard months get in the way of a possible beautiful future.
Not sure why you got downvoted so hard when everybody above is saying the same thing.
Didn’t ruin anything imo. He made one of my favorite films of all time
"In case you're wondering, Nintendo does put a bittering agent in their Switch cartridges...and it tastes horrible. "
If I wanted to send a message about how much I hate my life and get literally no response then I could just text my mother.
She should not defend herself? Stop blaming both sides.
Because [NAME] had a foot injury that I think he sustained at practice for the second half of the year.
The left has hurt itself in its confusion!
"huh. if there’s no pain, you’re fine. maybe just use spray on like axe or something to detour the smell "
I’m sorry. He’s in a better place. I hope you can keep the good memories
"OMG its youuuuuuu u/Sippinthatminttea. I remember you 😆 😆 😆 ""interesting creature"" 😋 😂 "

"Just like that fucking idiot that was just trying to kidnap that woman, and chased her into a Karate studio... turned out just about the same."
It's a shame that so many experimental psychology studies are still using such dubious statistical practices.

"Ha, my husband goes out after you guys have done your thing and checks for himself, he's been burned too many times."
why the fuck is this getting downvoted
Fake The monkey was a paid actor!
Maybe write your own music and it won’t get taken down.
"I'll say no thanks to endangering others in traffic. And miss me with the ""I drive better while high"""
And whatever other slowness and rootkits etc may come with Epic. I still havent forgotten Sonys bullshit or how resource hogging Origin was
It's really odd. My friend's search results are still normal but mine aren't
"Always remember that when problems get hardcore, Pornshit will be there to Worst them."
"The fact that you stayed this long really doesn’t but the blame on him, you chose this relationship "
I am so looking forward to in 5 years when people will be linking screenshot of all the hate on the frontpage these days and laughing about those heathens.
Yeah i also like [NAME] now but that gives me a horrible idea. What if we think the same about fortnite later
"Most of us think it’s just a conditioning thing right now, but we don’t really know"
Worst deal on the leafs right now easily
As a society we should be ashamed of the fact that this is even a question. Let the suffering stop obviously.

"Oh my god, zero-calorie Gatorade is a thing ^(i don't care how many chemicals are in it if its zero-calorie)"
"Too bad he endorses seiko, this wouldve been a great ad"
Both consenting adults so nope not creepy
This is a weird thing to be concerned about.
This is one of the worst written posts I've seen on this sub for a while
"lmao, have not heard that insult before, that's a good one. Only good thing you have come up with yet and I bet you stole it kek."
"Not out of a trash can though, surely? That'd be disgusting."
Cut the guy off and gave him a yes-no question. Which he exasperatedly answered. This is not the way to listen.
Could you imagine? That would be so terrible for viewers. 😂
Sadly this is how you get shit fixed
"Each Dark Souls game has been voted ""Most Likely to Result in Controller Damage""."
Why is it that young girls seem to idolise serial killers? I had a friend like this and never understood the attraction. It's scary
"What if I went around with a bat and stalked down every socialist I could find? Socialism killed more innocent [NAME] then [NAME], remember? "
Rape cases are up in Chicago too. It's just a reflection of more people reporting them rather than there actually being more rapes.
"You've been a sad boi around here for the last week straight, you'd do well to take a break."
It's also surprising that Valve released a dud game. Maybe it's time for Valve to grow up and introduce themselves to the digital communication age?
"Time consuming too, but buying a box that size outright is stupidly expensive—even if you order a bundle of 25 at a time."
Happy birthday and I'm really glad I won't be feeling like you when you wake up tomorrow
"I told you, he’s not a menace!"
Yes! Im glad you see where he got that n-word take from 😂😂
ahhhhh no how dare i have morals of course the most important thing is that my favorite football team has a better special teams coordinator
Freedom? Not in New 2013 and it’s gotten a lot worse since
I'm just glad I've never heard of this game before otherwise this news would be disappointing.
"Hahaha! Omg, that’s so funny. Thanks for taking one for the team. I heard it was bad but not that bad. "
"Still, that's quite the life. A [RELIGION] vegetarian causing mayhem, drinking with bands and almost getting serenaded by [NAME]!"
I hate text speak . Do you really want to dumb down your argument more than you need to?
My rabbit had one just like this before she passed. I hope the animal is okay.
Still saddened by the fact that we never got to see prime [NAME] vs prime [NAME].
They wanted [NAME] to be in the cameo and both to wish her happy birthday as specified in the order
"Hypothetically if [NAME] makes a run with foles and decides to trade wentz, I’d give up [NAME] in a heartbeat"
"I'm afraid you're completely correct. Sad, but true."
Honestly [NAME] is just enjoying his 350k and sits at home to play Fortnite ar this point. He’s done for
No problem. Glad you were able to take something away from that.
Absolutely. I have 3 kids with this woman. My guilt is compounded because I will be tearing their worlds apart too.
Tuck her in and give her a kiss on the forehead
I’m also glad I’m not the only one that swears a lot at the bastard objects.
I’m so homesick and I come here for photos like this.
This joke is disgusting and offensive. Dictionaries don't contain proper nouns!
these people are holding our country back. Im happy natural selection is taking its course.
Opinions? I mean that's just a statement.
So. Much. Reality.Can’t. Take. Anymore. Reality. Not. Scripted.One.Bit. 🙃
This. Nothing would make me happier than the see the gNats hamstrung for the next decade because they gave a ridiculous contract to a hometown hero.
I mean people at YouTube with the ability to remove the kids channel This post was basically a poor quality rant about incompetence on the end of YouTube not the community
"WHEN I DO BEGIN TO PEAK, ALL OF [NAME] WILL KNOW!"
"Thats dope. But looks dumb when you write it. Should be, Forum 41. Or, 41st Forum or something like that."
You have no perspective. Go outside and get some friends.
"Oof, what a bad and dated meme"
No i didn’t all i know is that i binged 3 seasoms of it.
"Oh wow, that was a serendipitous ending! The weed saved her life. "
With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn’t be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
"I was also terribly confused. I’ll jump on and play with you sometime, working tonight unfortunately."
And the problem is that they took doctors out of a&e and out patients and community services and gp's to pay for his monstrosity...
"This made me lol, I don't want to sound racist but.... *goes completely ham with the racism*"
Because you are young and it happens. You feel like you’ll never find someone else but you will.
Ii can't believe you just said that!
When people don't understand things they invent gods. how little we have changed in all these years.
[NAME] has some perpetual depression. Nothing makes him happy. Unfortunately I just don't see him succeeding at Chelsea in the true sense.
yeah this doesn’t represent our fan base well. gg guys!
HYS is the worst Internet comments section. It makes Youtube comments look like Gardeners Question Time.
"Haven't played anything else as long as it's been up, no matter if duos or squads"
It was more just “where did all these airpods come from?!” It was weird to me.
I was surprised the general public hadn't already heard of them tbh. They have been around for quiet sometime.
"I gotta take credit for YouTube because he recommends some sick underground artists but old ones? Never, at least for me"
[NAME] has to be spinning in his grave right now
"Yes, but shockingly that was the first post of hers I’ve read in years that didn’t make me want to claw my eyes out. "
Possibly. I just couldn’t go any further with it. Not after that.
Pikachu shocked.jpg I hope we give him a fair chance and he succeeds
His army of Swedish blondes are going to be upset.
Can’t believe people still fall victims to those machines.

"Damn, 14 year olds in 2019 are bigger shits than I was when I was 14."
"Ooh sorry, I didn't reread the article. I just remembered seeing it on Instagram. I'll add an edit"
[NAME] has continued to show how selfish she is throughout the years..we shouldn't be surprised at this. [NAME] forbid she be the bigger person for the kids.
That gives me flashbacks to when my mom used to record me crying because she thought it was funny. Ugh.
im trying to but my depression gets the better of me i have my good days and bad days
"as a guy who has the ability to repair circuit boards, oh god oh fuck this is beyond cursed"
Sorry but the majority of console players will agree that he needs nerfed and nerfed hard
Is there a reason you said yes but then did not?
"Exactly. We’re only here for the money, assholes. "
It wouldn’t be our biggest free agent signing in a second considering he’s not a free agent.
This post is not going to age well.
"Please, please, please don't do that to yourself. You'll end feeling worse when this guy leaves you. "
you are truly a hogwartsian saint and exmo beautiful one. GG
Okay thats cool I was asking because I didn’t know y’all better stop downvoting me
“Attack on masculinity” I’m dying over here you fragile motherfucker.
[NAME] is another worthless [NAME]. Utah is unbelievably stupid for voting for him.
This kid now: fun yay hahoo This kid as a grownup: I regret everything
Couldn’t find my wallet for the last 4 days. This also happens to be an awesome way to not spend any money.
Which suggests nothing in itself. The same mods you claim are abusive are probably as hyperbolic about the racism issue as you are.
That's your justification? You're a terrible person. Correction: You're a terrible child. Get some help.
Because I want to be with someone but no one wants to be with me.
[NAME] left that on purpose. Would bnever have scored
"Play the lottery my dude, you just got lucky."
"Yeah, I was very sad to read that!"
I got an unsolicited text from wal-mart earlier today and I almost went into orbit. Spam texts are completely unacceptable.
The thought of him having to schedule me in really turns me off and makes me sad. Has the reduced gaming time helped with intimacy in any way?
You're simply suggesting betrayal in a different form.
"Three words, no subtlety. ""Dude. Stop. Seriously."" "
You forgot about cats. They’re all talking about their cats.
I’ve never heard of a vet adopting out pets before.
Lol i got bottled by one of them in a brawl with a bunch of the nazis
Understandable. Retail sucks and people are nut
"I'm sorry you needed to add this. I thought your humour was pretty obvious, but this is reddit...."
"Considering the fact that I don't consider jealousy or envy useful, you are dead wrong. It might be other people but not me."
I watched the whole thing. I miss that style of cartoon. Simultaneously silly and understated.
Sad truth is you cant run away from who you are no matter how hard you try :(
That was what our media guys said but he is now 1/3 in the shootout (was 1/2). No clue how they butchered that one so badly.
That’s terrible; I would be devastated. You had to get out of there though. I’m thinking of you.
I lived across the street from it as a child. Used to swim in it as a kid...Ignorance is bliss.
"I reject that [NAME] can't defend. Now his legs being gone, that might ""have legs"" "
Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.
Oh how lovely and vague. Your non-committal form of conversation is delicious.
"What was the ""injustice?"" Nothing happened to him. Assuming his story was not hugely exaggerated to fit the victim card."
So you're saying there's a chance I'm a bot... I don't even know what's real anymore!
It really sucks people are downvoting you just because they were worried about blowing themselves up just like us nova bomb users.
As someone who is about to be 29 this is the realest thing I’ve ever seen.
If you have to ask you're too uncool to be allowed in.
I wonder if the school closures with MLK holiday reduce the priority to plow ...
"Doesn't matter how much experience you have, you're still delusional and most likely attracted to the ""wrong"" kinds of men"
...and life can be very good when you free yourself from that fear!
Anyone know how high of a fall that was? Edit: ~4 seconds of falling. .5 X 9.8 X 4^2 = ~78 feet.
"Suddenly, a loud audible groan from every structural/civil engineer in Maryland that now have to deal with that bullshit :/"
" I'm scared to even ask my mom ,I might get yelled at 😟"
Wow so glad [NAME] is getting it done quicker. Better for later in tourney
It’s nice to know that no one cares enough to send me either.
But once again that is a problem with the people. So many just attack the people who disagree instead of the arguments.
"I remember that. It was a crushing experience that started a whole other level of depression. But hey, maybe things will work out for you. "
"I don't even care about the draft, I've tasted playoff hopes and I'm not going back."
After 8? I'm afraid after 5. It gets dark here early. :(
"Ok, so you're not actually going to rebut anything. Good night."
">You can't purge dissenting opinions over there like you do here. Yes, because top minds definitely doesn't purge dissenting opinions. "
"Dude, y'all anti American scum don't even believe in science. Fuck off with your generic bullshit because you can't list a specific example. "
:). I got you brotha. Dame says hi
Idk you seem pretty miserable and really bitter and angry. It must be exhausting and I hope you find happiness some day.
I was entertained into the 4th. My sons played well. We lost. I'll take it.
"I'm happy that you got the [NAME] back, some people just don't have respect for others and think that they and their kids deserve everything"
"How stupid are you, if you dont réalize it’s staged "
I can't believe he told that story. I'm sure the minister that released the water is now so totally regretting not asking for a bj!
A shame our driver education programs in the U.S. are pretty much a joke as compared to those in Germany.
good luck! i recently left the floor for an office job and couldn’t be happier.
I like they think that it’s bad that we are thinking about the fucking POTUS. It’s almost like his actions effect us all
"Hate the taste, switched to a plastic nalgene bottle"
"Hard to describe, but I get a more relaxed sleep with cbd."
He is just awful enough to do something like that.
I get migraines too and I’m sooo tired the first two days of my period
"Yep, lack of proper coaching yet again. Sucks we missed out on [NAME]. "
Find a new doctor. If he isn't willing to treat people because of political affiliation then he's a horrible doctor and an even worse person.
None at all. I dont like kids and dont want them. I got a vasectomy and it's a done deal. Zero regrets
"I like to believe he faked his own death, so he can enjoy his many Bitcoin coins and wealth. "
"Ones with close ties to SA, anyway. An escaped apostate won't exactly be itching to run home."
"I'm not gonna lie, I'm guilty of being triggered by people buying NASA shit but don't really care about it. "
It’s so easy to go on killstreaks in the prequel maps except Geonosis. You just suck.
French fried when he should have pizza'd and had a bad time.
"Slowing down does not equal stopping, the answer to stopping this is at a government level, not praying that corporations want to leave possible profits alone."
I started out by being sick.. and the realization that no one is going to help me... Not even my family not friends.
Cheers to a better 2019 for our boys!! Can’t be much worse then 2018
I am so blessed to be a lesbian.
"I mean, it’s kind of her problem. She blithely makes so many mental errors. "
"OK, I'll be glad to help you with your trip! "
I actually don’t mind Sudbury to Nipigon but whole North Ontario sucks overall.
"😀ahhh I see what you did there, clever."
Definitely not angry. He who smelt it dealt it.
Such bullshit. Reloading components included? Not that they'd let that stand in subsequent laws if it is.
"That 2nd goal was all [NAME]. What a move, and against the best team in the league!"
"I don't date women who smoke. As for pills or syringes etc, I don't find recreational drug users attractive. Similarly for being drunk."
One of my favs was when we were in the playoffs against the Habs and we won all five fights in a line brawl
Everyone who is complicit in all this should be punished and questioned as to why they allowed this to happen. Complete disgrace!
The visual change is an underrated buff. The few times you could juke a legion as survivor were likely due to his blur that just got lessened.
Wow fuk I'm watching that right now
Foot fetish people like pretty feet. Those are not.

"> So basically, if you're responsible with guns, you have nothing to worry about. I'm worried about *other people* not being responsible with guns."
No we don't. A small amount is imported into Ontario. The rest of Canada is long or balanced.
I'm so sorry. Read about you getting kicked out at home. That must be devastating
"Really glad the US just passed transparent pricing for healthcare providers, but it's just a first step."

Me too. I have so much shit and I can’t imagine taking any of it into my car and piling it that high. Wtf?
[NAME]. [NAME] and [NAME] just style on these scrubs with fucking mecha Tai Chi.
Every time I see this it makes me so happy.
"I'm 31 and didn't even have my first cell phone, period, until I was 20. This is just more anthropological fake news."

">Some ~~drugs~~ people are just... Scary... Some drugs tend to bring out what's bubbling under the surface, so in that way, yeah. "
A better description would be she got a nasty fright rather than it being terrifying.
It's to bad I live in a society that only wants my continual existence.
"A supposedly professional article banging on about gammons and insulting people's appearance. Not an impressive display of journalism, just a pathetic blog designed to preach to the choir."

I miss [NAME]. Shame he had to get injured while he was here
"Yeah this bothers me. Family should be off limits, and this scene was really sad"
I am some how [NAME] in every situation even if I’m not in a team 😕
"[NAME] and [NAME] = The hero's we need, but not the hero's we deserve."
The argument [NAME] is making is that expecting women to cook is considered sexist but expecting men to shovel snow is fine. It's about the double standard.
Unfortunately for me you have to be 23 or older to drive for TMC
"As a democrat, even I am afraid of a super majority. "

The thought of shooting anything at asylum seekers is appalling.
"Loved seeing [NAME] play for us, but definitely excited to see what [NAME] can do."
Because this is a poorly run franchise. This is a bad team.
People would still always parry them (600ms) :(

Loooool I didn’t know that it’s ridiculous
Yikes. She sounds like she's one bad grade away from shooting up a synagogue.

Nah. It's their job. Just tip well
"WHERE THR HECK IS VOL'JIN AND MY TROLL EMPIRE, YEARS HAVE PASSED WE HAVE 2 PANDA AND STILL ONE TROLL"
Chicken and the egg argument. Gun companies don't donate to [NAME] *because* they have gun control on their platform. This goes back decades mind you.

I'm glad that you are still harboring feelings from a game that ended in 2016.

They were not [NAME] and they don't know the identity of them !
"That's not really true, people judge all the time, it's just that they're usually too busy judging themselves to judge you too. "
"Haha not in those words, but I did say it was dramatic and unreasonable."
The next step in human evolution is for humanity to end. Life isn't worth preserving.
"No foreplay, no connection, if he doesn't know what he's doing. If he asks for a blow job and then refuses to reciprocate. "
I find it unfortunate that you use gender-non-conformance as an insult.
Uh-a... Everyone is so righteous from the comfort of a couch. I wonder how cults and terrorism exist if everyone is so awesome.
What was the original post? If it was as awful as this one my comment would still apply!
Get out. And take your facts with you.
Being born in north america is a curse my friend. Oregon (my home) is kind of like Ireland weather wise though I hear.
[NAME] had talked about this entire operation is shady with an anti abortion agenda that's hidden behind their intentionally misleading name.
"You can get into big, fuck up your life forever trouble."
None of these people ever seem to have run their own business.
I hate his hoist a shit shot and throw your legs forward so you can draw a foul on the defender for crowding your landing space.
Unfortunately this is just as illegal as impeding traffic all over the city.

That troll and his Kotaku cronies have no shame. None at all.
"My opinion is that this person's opinion is stupid, fallacious, and bad."
Pam Beesly and Jim... What a waste.
Then [NAME] insults [NAME] and he cries
1 is spot on. Anxiety completely disappears. I like when that happens. One less issue
Omg I'm so dumb I didn't even think of it like that.
How can they tell if someone is a conservative? It's not like most of us go around wearing MAGA hats and Thomas Sowell patches on leather jackets.
Does 'unintentional humor' mean 'I sneered at this'?
I'd be ok if they didn't have a HoF. But they do so I want the deserving players from the team I root for represented
After 8? I'm afraid after 5. It gets dark here early. :(

That’s Grandpa [NAME]. I stomp flaming bags with my boots
"Naw, I'm good, you're already getting your ass handed to you in this thread."
Lol ok. So saying a garbage clip doesn't belong at the top of a gaming subreddit makes me a [NAME].
Using an argument based on intolerance is frankly a bad strategic idea and borders on offensive. It won't persuade anybody and it sounds ridiculous.
Deep blue eyes look weird to me. The rest seems pretty good.
There is nothing more disgusting than those who put children in danger unless it is the people who allow them to do more harm.
A bit of storybook now and again never hurt anyone :D So happy for the both of you!
This is child abuse. No decent parent would force their kid to starve just because they don't understand science and nutrition

Don't worry about stupid people and you do whatever you want. Screw them kind of people.
*Super Dark Times* was awesome. Those kids were great actors. They really tuned in on the bleakness of the situation.
yeah certainly shouldn't feel this way but i do now :/
Um yea. You’re being creepy. Stop stalking her
That was my mistake. It should only show your First Name and The 1st letter of my last name.
Reddit is so right wing I can’t even believe it
No you are providing more than enough evidence. Post histories do exist. Now fuck off.
That’s better:-) now go get em tiger
I'm sorry that happened. Was her hospice nurse aware that she was suffering?
Ya got a good life... *ya got a good life...*
natural selection will rape her anyway so...
These people in here are joking about holding down and cutting their neighbors faces. It's pretty gross.
I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story.
Im done talking to you because i can expect better response from a wall. Feel bad for you. I hope it isnt too cold in your moms basement
I don't think playing with her hair would work. Thats just creepy.
No it doesn't work like that you're wrong
Is that because it's an accurate description of the politician and he's trying to distract from his guilt?
"~~macri gato~~ Also, nice to see Buthan there"
Twice in that article he implies these minority communities aren't ordinary [NAME]. It's disgusting.

"Amazing that Aunt [NAME] wouldn't genuinely reflect on her her behavior, or realize that she is raising a spoiled, rude child."

No it’s a lie because he could not possibly have been in Vietnam. And he did not correct a single outlet who said he was.
This is scary to know that you went through. People like this are one step away from coming home with a gun or knife.
"RIP [NAME], you were a sweet girl. It's been over 10 years but I still miss you."
"Thanks grandpa, it’s always good to see you around the holidays. That joke is hilarious every time!"

Really? Cuz hella 18 year olds with bad grades from my high school seemed to do it with ease.
Pure unconsitional love can also be dangerous: if the other person turns out to be an abuser you should propably stop loving them
"Apparently, he can't just have sex with anyone because he needed to rape someone."
It doesn't sound like there is much that isn't a waste of money in your opinion.
Damn. So you went back to an old medication and found it no longer worked for you??? I didn't even know that was possible.
I honestly couldn’t care less about your opinion at this point
"Our draft choices are horrible anyway, it doesn't matter where we pick."
I learned about [NAME] about 1749485 times in medical school lmao Soap helped a ton but it just did not cut it after a while
I haven't had class in three years and yet I've literally had this nightmare dozens of times.
In many circles this would be considered a steal
"It got completely banned I think, saw a post about it a while back in r/gore."
When you glossed over [NAME] history to make a cheap shot at a democrat. That type of dishonesty is kind of your trademark
Well I mean this game is so stupid in a lot of ways tbh
Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions.
That should usually be the giveaway—though they now wear these ridiculous waist-high tights to hide the fact they don’t have workout bodies either.

"Yeah. 99percent of ""cute"" videos of mixed species on reddit make me anxious because all I can see is bad animal husbandry. "

"> like a fucking peregrine falcon, her and him beeline straight for her bedroom. Are they falcons or bees? Alphas don't mix metaphors."
Why the hell do we sit trae in crunch time we probably won't win. Give him the XP. Very frustrating.

Nope. Not atm anyway. I somewhat doubt they’ll ever add upgraded satchels but it would certainly be welcomed.

Sadly the same way know people who know people and being in public. Maybe an online game with chat like league or xbox
Really because it looks like the judge is allowing the case to proceed. Must mean there's some merit to the claims.
Did people really go against [NAME] when he came out? I wasn't as in to his stuff at the time but I remember people being supportive.
I named my new kitten Baker and you can bet your ass that he’s getting posted here next time there is a flood of doggo posts

[NAME] being the ROY and the DSJ situation has def distracted the media on how bad [NAME] has been
Dude I spit after this comment. I haven’t laughed like that in awhile.
So happy to see these as the top two comments. My lips turned to prunes just watching this.
No. You have to have killed her due to negligence or the like. Manslaughter is essentially the crime of accidentally killing someone because you did something careless.
Putting any human on the same level as [NAME] is sacrilegious and you should be ashamed for spreading such blasphemy.
I knew I'd see him here eventually. I really like his animations. They're cute and funny
Definite Fridge Horror moment for that movie. That poor man.
Everyone in this video is annoying. This seems like a terrible place to go hang out.
OP may have been avoiding [NAME] jokes.
The other leg is a blurred line
Sounds like they’re not responsible and shouldn’t have the right to have these.

What was the original post? If it was as awful as this one my comment would still apply!
Who is this Wild team? Where have they been?
What's even worse: the deciding voter refused to support the subway because he was strangely obsessed with a horse & buggy transit plan from 1858.

"Nah, this is actually my cat! He’s just the only other person I know that would eat em"
"Honestly, I'm just happy I got traded to you guys, rather than a team like the Leafs or H*bs"
Because he's attractive. Hence [NAME] come out in droves to defend him despite the fact he's a horrid asshole.

"Sweet home alabama No but for real, is that even legal? You should stop having sex with her."
This thread is being brigaded by atheist/agnostics. They are just here to cause trouble. Look at OPs post history.
Why would he get upset? Your husband was the one who went to PreCana classes and knows that using contraception is a means for annulment.
"Awesome, glad you like it. I need to get one this week now."
"It’s shame that despite the years of dedication, persistence, and hard work. His efforts are reduced because of his height."
"Hence I used ""weird"". I know it's awkward, but it was indoctrinated into us growing up."
But what if that's the only job I would enjoy?
Patience. Give it another day or so. Send a text telling her you enjoyed her company and wanna do it again. Hopefully she responds

"No no, We miss Uncle [NAME]. He cared about is. Until Aunt [NAME] moved in 😕"
"The trouble is, he ate the ice-cream anyway. Some fucking moral fortitude right there."
The same comedy bit [NAME] has disavowed because it's used almost exclusively in circumstances like this? It's an awful and weak explantation.
What an awful last 10 minutes. Can't even make one pass to someone.
"Damn, I didn’t see any monkeys when I was there! What a ripoff."
Now it's cheering for the two to come back
I feel like [NAME] would have laughed at it though. It was a one-liner. I thought it was funny.
Your ass after I beat you so hard you shit yourself
"Why did you repost this 7 hours after your initial post!? And to the same sub!? Yo, that's not cool man."
Replace smug with thug and you'll see how racist you are
She's just going to suck you back in.
I'd also report to the post office... and next time these nasty neighbors come-give them the number to call and complain.

A year ago I said that this continuous ISO by Houston is disgusting to watch. It s still disgusting.
Why was the discrimination and ghettoization of [NAME] prior to their extermination legal? Because legislators sometimes don't care for morality.
They won VEGAS not the PRO LEAGUE QUALIFIER. Stop trying to bait me

Nice-full circle! Leaving [NAME] for dust- I love it.

Everything purdue throws up goes in. Frustrating. Need to find a way to get stops or this ones over at halftime
I hate the way [NAME] kisses people. Like smushing his face in a figure 8 on their lips. Ugh
This cheat... what would that be? I may have made a choice I'm currently regretting.
Oh what a day! What a lovely day!
I completely agree! It's cold at first but makes you feel so alive and invigorated by it too. It's a total shock to the system.
No one wants the wrong person executed for a crime fool
"Looks wise you sound dateable but no, I wouldn't date you, because you seem to have an overemphasis on appearance"
Well glad she got out of the situation safely. I would much rather NOT have to investigate and know someone is safe.

[NAME] [NAME] is like the 72hrs from console of course we like him wtf<3
I don't like [NAME] this season but she's always been a favorite before. Am I the only one? She has an edge that seems unlikable
I saw at least one user on this forum talking badly about [NAME] for missing playing time.
"I FFed it too and reading that comment, I am sooooooooo glad I did!"
I don’t know if that’s a better or worse reason for wearing the arm band :(
Sounds exactly how it is - you don't want a relationship with this girl. It's pretty cut and dry.

Thank you. So many people out there that would rather be right and in a grave than swallow their pride and do the safer thing.
Especially that “Australia ain’t gonna cop it” ad on TV god I hate [NAME]
This is me being hopeful that there’s not one poor soul out there who’s happy that the Wilpons are our owners
You don't follow [NAME]. You're a hypocrite following man's interpretation of the word of [NAME]. Youre too stupid to even be embarrassed.
Who is bored? I happily entertain myself.
"Correct. I still play NHL Faceoff 98 and I always turn that rule off, because it's terrible."
It's not exactly hard to keep track.
I prefer having the TV in the background more than music. Music is something I enjoy in the car or walking in the city.
"I'm torn between [NAME] and [NAME]. [NAME] is next man up for scoring now, especially if [NAME] keeps riding the pine. "
That's because he played the end of the game when they were feeding [NAME] with no results.
Alternative: He didn’t live as long as he thought he would. He died mid-sentence while writing a

"Yeah, it's disgusting & I'm so disturbed by everything going on. Never ever would I have believed this is where people were headed. "
"Then there you have it. From everything I have seen thus far, this game is doomed. I hate saying that."
I don’t understand the point you’re making sorry
"Wow! Thanks! We’re working on it! Glad you liked it (this is [NAME], the [NAME] one)... appreciate your support!"
Shut yer mouth libtard and get yer MAGA on! /s
"Someone will actually spend their money on this too, that’s the sad part"
You severely misunderstand the evidence if your answer is 'NO TO ALL' regarding your questions. Especially the last one.
So glad to hear that! you go girl<3

No you said communism is a more extreme form of socialism.
Omg yes lol it’s the story of my life

Report her to the police. Physical threats are a no-no.
I forsee success in your future endeavors.
I bet everyone is commenting hoping to get plat or gold......i dont blame them

Just made my first robocough purchase. Glad I used the website
Terrorism is the systematic use of violence to achieve a political goal. [NAME] has not used violence.
Vox lies and manipulates information to drive their agenda. Same as right wing garbage. They are not an honest media outlet.
Plus [NAME] has won before. [NAME] is a perennial loser. All he has ever done is played on teams that were the worst in the NHL.
"Because the first part of the day was pretty lame, amirite?"
I thought this was a torb skin and I was about to die
I feel his pain. Bad dxm trips are the most terrifying thing in the moment but they're way more forgiving than bad psych trips
I sort of did lol. I think what I mean is that you cant look at it as an alternative to rdp

Not starting it at that temperature is a great way to drain your car of an ability to start. Pick your poison.
You’re argument is so bad you’re now asking people to deny common sense because you can’t prove your point LOL super pathetic

When bear attacks kick him I'm the ball!
[NAME] man..... I hope this is just one of his overdramatic moments on the floor... He's scared me like 5 times this year....
Why would anyone forget how dominant he is? Lmao Oh yea we suck.
Or at least a couple more visits to the booth. I enjoyed hearing him adding to the banter.
bournemouth v chelsea took under 3.5 3-0 then in the 95th minute bournemouth grab another. feels bad man
There’s still 12 episodes left compared of the two he’s been out. It’s too early to be making that kind of claim.
We have tradable assets next year and cap space the year after. We don’t need to implode to retool.
What's it matter where this came from? It fits every content guideline and we're enjoying it.
"They wont touch a hero if they tweaked it in last 6-12 months. Like [NAME], they fucked/nerfed her and thats it."
"I haven't defended trump whatsoever, you're completely missing my point"
She has no idea. You've got this ♡
"Considering that the picture OP jerked was fake and that the OP of the faked picture was rude as fuck to absolutely EVERYONE, that’s completely false. "
"I know, and the unfortunate thing is many of my friends in this area have had somewhat similar experiences with dudes who just are just total creeps. "

As far as I know [NAME] alcoholism and [NAME] diabetus are untreated.
"19??? Yikes slow down, enjoy yourselves and figure yourselves out. Not an age to make big decisions like that, I say at 24..."
It is like how I imagine [NAME] and [NAME] people seeing wooden ships across the water the first time.
What the fuck is this doing in a cryptocurrency sub
[NAME] damn what a comeback. I love this teams fight.
I tried doing this for my son but he was afraid of it.
I'm so sorry you were bullied in a place you should have felt safe.
Personally I'm wondering why our OP didn't go with the clone angle. That's way more insane than them just being sent to prison.
I know but it just makes me gag.
You explain to him that passing efficiency stats are garbage and are a terrible way to judge a QB's performance.
Ugh. The Google Plus BB community is the absolute worst!!!
[NAME] just think of how overworked her liver and kidneys must be!!
"Damn, you just reminded me how good that feels..."
"A horrendous amount of Sesame oil, god, that would be awful."
I'll add to this: be prepared to not get closure or questions answered. This is the hardest lesson I had with my break up.
Isn't she like a worse version of [NAME]? I always hear from everyone that she is pretty trash.
What fun is this?? I love it!
I mean yeah that's really it. Getting him on tape saying racist stuff is the only possibility of a sale.
"People will go mental hoarding food, so you should be hoarding food, not like those idiots that panic. I'm confused."

I’m just glad that the academy is FINALLY progressive enough to nominate a mediocre [NAME] biopic directed by a pedophile.
"Really? I live down the street from there, thanks!!!"
Very frustrating. And totally the fault of your school’s systems for handling the issue. Sorry you have to deal with it.
No way we would turn down [NAME] for [NAME]. BS

I would say the same thing except I can’t cuz it didn’t immediately fall and everything break.
Wow. Some people are so stupid. But if it was me I would have opened the door and at least put it inside the doorway.
Thank you for that :) I'm not OP but I am really happy to read your comment.
that is not true. I often shoot the rifle round the blast 2 shots from the double barrel. Unless it got changed recently.
The idea that fb might be slowly killing mlms out there gives me a glimmer of satisfaction...
...it's almost like an uber individualistic fringe political ideology does not inspire communal teamwork political action lmao.
Posts like these make it more and more clear how creepy [NAME] is
This is awesome. You can really see how little wasted motion [NAME] had—everything looked effortless.
No. Can’t wait till it’s legal here
I feel the exact same way. It makes me so insecure
You've described my parents who have been happily married for 36 years. You are good dude.

I couldn’t live like this. You should leave.

Happy Cake Day [NAME]! Use what talents you possess: the woods would be very silent if no birds sang there except those that sang best.
The worst thing about this tweet is how many likes and retweets it got
This is hilarious! Sounds similar to my buddy's experience at his gym in CoHeights!
"Yea, very rude. Avoid anything with a strong smell like fish and popcorn, curry is just as strong. "
"Exactly, humans are selfish. That was kinda my point, my reasons are superficial and only affect me. Theirs are not. "
"Oh no. Your poor friend, I hope she can move past it someday. That has to be such a hard burden to carry."
Can someone summarise it here? I can’t get past the paywall.
"Damn, that's the only war we lost. "
It's very interesting that the fresh water doesn't just dilute the salt water
What an immature response. With a little passive agressive racism to boot. Classy.
We might now be almost maybe nearly ready to potentially maybe play finals. I think [NAME] will make the finals this year. They'll be the surprise team.
Thank you so much for posting this! I've thought this way for a long time and it's very comforting to see that I'm not alone :3
Same. Wasn't good enough. Left broken. Edit: more broken

"I know. Maybe if they realize this, they'll stop using that app."
That's what I said! Except the bad person part but ya know what I mean.
This is either beautiful..or just about the stupidest thing I've read in weeks. Here's hoping for fantastic satire!
[NAME] gets punched in the head and gets a penalty.
This post and thread are killing me
No no no. They only have no worth if they don’t support [RELIGION].
Except forming an opinion of a topic without even having basic knowledge of said topic makes you sound pretty arrogant and entirely undercuts your opinion.
Just wondering why they called the cops but not an ambulance seeing as how he was covered in blood and disoriented.

Df1 masterrace. Noctis on 3 bar is bullshit though.
This year would’ve been the year to start it... we’ll likely be losing the heart of our team after this season
How can anyone like Tottenham? Like for real. They are the worst team you could imagine in every department.
"Hate to be that guy, but that's not DDR, that's Pump It Up, the Korean DDR rip-off."

I love it when they show tons of interest. Love it.
"Partial reopening within the next two weeks for services to the [NAME], but unfortunately for some a lot of the government is never coming back from this."
"Based on her other post she's young, pregnant and possibly homeless. Looking for help and advice."
"Fair enough, but that doesn't mean she won't in 2020."
I fail to see how a current moderator isn't capable. Perhaps they never delegated the task is all.
This just oozes passive-agressiveness. I love it!
I blinked at the perfect moment and thought no one was going to save that man.
It is the recent patch most likely! This never happened previously.
So you'll bleed and be in pain twice that day.
Looks like a plate to me. A stupid plate. But a plate nonetheless.
Rural MO. The nearest Whole Foods is an hour away. I can't imagine too many [NAME] could handle the distance.
You clearly read about the young [NAME] footage and made his very bad fan fiction

Detective Pikachu with gun violence would be too much for me.

"It's not you, Taco Bell is grade D racoon meat and isn't fit for human consumption."

"Fuck people that don't like pbr, only cheap bear I'll drink next to natty boh"

Then how can you say the rest is very red outside of nova when that is blatantly not true?
"That is the issue with most things, if you work there you can not win, as well as friends and family members."

That shit sent me on a fucking journey to read.
"Sadly not. [NAME] confirmed they couldn't make female premier skins for male characters and vice versa, because their hurt/hit boxes are different from one another."
It's not that bad. Not even the employees were cringe worthy. I'm glad that they were all enthused about having fun with the seniors.
And I taught my room was dirty and that I was not taking care of my self. Good job op
You were used as a weapon to inflict pain on your father. Glad you reconnected and found a good parent.
"Their behavior? Going to campuses to talk about fiscal responsibility and [RELIGION] values is something that is bad? You’re a bigot, just admit it. "

Wouldn't you think it's better to just show up earlier?
Thank you! I still cant believe someone could be so selfish and awful and deliberately try to ruin Christmas for kids. So awful.

Kinda weird after you find out he wrote those songs while thinking about underage girls.
"Which sucks, because it's a *bitch* to find replacements for those."
Shut up [NAME] we’ve had enough of experts
When I got to grow old yet... They'll either remember how much damage it all is just ridiculously macabre.

"I'm so disappointed you didn't include [NAME] ""I'm standing under the source of the bull shit"" [NAME]"
It's not like it's a bad thing...
"I'm all for not getting too crazy because we've had a rough stretch, but [NAME] scoring twice hurt. A lot."
That's only bad to some people. Being racist is bad to everyone.
Good luck OP! I'm rooting for you!
It wasn't any better 10 years ago if that offers any sense of relief.

"That ""Hard work"" usually involved the junkrat pressing Q so I'm not about to shed tears"
Nice try with your 1/3 pan and t rex arms there buckaroo /s
Banner price is down to 100k donuts. And I still don't have enough..... (sad face)
Looks like one of mine too. Such a horribly raised entitled rude brat
"Forehead kisses, and any of the cute nicknames he calls me [NAME], best feeling being in his arms [NAME] I miss it all"
Wow! There's no reason for this comment!
"She could've liked you before you guys connected on the other app, just left swipe her and never bring it up."
I am surprised Facebook can't detect a non mobile device and redirect to the normal page.
This is why I’m afraid to fly.
It is a racist nickname because you're literally using the man's race as a means to criticize him.
"Man, fuck that shit. He lost us the Sonics, he has no business running for public office."
"Unfortunately that's a long old way from Sydney, but I'm glad teams don't mind having non playing members "
I think it's insane how they reach out and then ignore. My ex does that. It gets on my f n nerves.
"Amazing that Aunt [NAME] wouldn't genuinely reflect on her her behavior, or realize that she is raising a spoiled, rude child."
"Yeah, people my age make me more anxious than older people. I feel like my generation is more judgmental."
Look I don’t mean to be rude but w
It makes being ugly even more pathetic. All that work just to create suffering.
I feel bad for laughing at this now that the creator of Spongebob passed away a month ago.
She sounds jealous of [NAME]. Sounds like she’s never had a decent relationship so that’s probably why she’s sabotaging her daughters relationship.
"That’s awesome, what do you do if you don’t mind me asking?"
"Dang, dawg. That one shocked me "
This is a bit of a political post but I just felt like venting.
"This is actually funny OP, stop trying to be so negative"
"Seriously, you wanna give me singles? Awesome. I don't have to ask management AGAIN for more ones. XD "
Oh certainly this winter has been mild. It just started taking a dump on us the last week or so
"What makes BDS anti-Semitic, as opposed to just anti-Israel? I see the two frequently conflated, which I think is a mistake."
Hahah you right. Please don't tell any birds!
That's the kind of person who'd fuck up making you a plain hamburger. That sack o' shit needs to be sent through a wood chipper.
Made me cry and my one year old golden who was laying near my feet ended up coming up and snuggling me.
"So what you’re saying is that the frogs used to use the chemicals on us? Oh, how the tables have turned."
I hope Dallas gets close and loses in heartbreak.
"He believed Ireland had a right to exist, he just didn’t believe in the way the IRA(1919-1921) went about their business. "
[NAME]. Think there’s some controversy over how common that was though
"I'm always stuck in platinum because every match is a loss, no healer what so ever"
"Hey there, Sorry to hear you were running into connectivity issues. How often do you see that error and when did it start happening for you? ^ET"
"But the battle dynamics are sh*t. Every other ME is better in that respect, especially the squad AI is bad. Really bad."
When you glossed over [NAME] history to make a cheap shot at a democrat. That type of dishonesty is kind of your trademark
A beautiful poem for a beautiful thing. Happy cake day btw!
"Not against us this season, apparently. "
"one dude puked on my patio, he fell out at 2am! weak!"
I gave up on the show over and over before I adopted 'just skip around'. Ended up finishing all of 3-6.
I mean I’m playing a card game and enjoying the cheap cards
Keep trying! :) I’ve just had a look and enjoyed the ones of yours I read.
Nope. Glad we came out with the W
Oh wow. You really know your stuff. Luckily I don't have diabetes yet so that's something
"Neat idea, but it looks terrible as a tool. It's faster to just separate with your hands. "
I hate [NAME] but this dude has already lied to Congress. How can you believe anything he says
I would do that all day until she learned not to put her dirty feet on the dash!!
She reminds me if [NAME]. Half haked pictures with vague sayings. Ugh
"You're didn't vote for her you are obviously a racist, sexist, homophobe, you're the worst kinda person."
My favorite new fan! Glad to see you here! Rest up and get ready for the Friday game.
"Am I the only one who is glad I saw this meme? I mean I'm officially traumatized, but still."
I mean clearly it's because they don't understand the pricing for babies/young children on the black market.
"It is a long panel but very insightful - skip the intro pleasantries if you want, but you will have seen enough by the 30 minute mark "
I would but they don't make anything that fits my needs.
We're not a democracy. WE'RE A COUNTRY
He died 4 days later of dehydration
"[NAME] pnr play has not been good, they are defending jok and letting him get to the rim"
Yes. The citizen received no “direct benefit or gain”. This is being looked at like someone paying for our lunch.
"Instant fucking turn off, ugh. Fuck us for wanting equality across the spectrum"
You mean 4 of 5 dates for you already this month. Wow - do tell!
"Minor league team names are often embarrassing...Biscuits, Rumble Ponies, Sand Gnats. Baby Cakes is particularly awful though, I’ll grant you that."
Honestly- live your life as a person who can love what others hate- because that’s just a little more joy in your life versus their hate.
Is it bad that im really bummed he didnt get hit?
It's also cruel how noone is informed about the execution at all. Relatives are left completely in the dark and likely never find out about their execution.
"No, but it can cost more than the minimum wage."
I meant one sided comment. My bad
"I have this too, so don't worry. We are not crazy. Just regular humans who happen to have an anxiety issue. "
Even farting after I shower makes me want another shower
These disgusting old hags are literally old school flesh-consuming ghouls. Like [NAME] or [NAME].
I don't believe that there's any justification for an authoritarian government.
My blood pressure Edit: I'm just happy to be here.
That face in 0:18. That's the face of happiness
"Service Ontario isn't a ministry, and I don't believe you're close friends with the heads of two ministries at all. "
Which suggests nothing in itself. The same mods you claim are abusive are probably as hyperbolic about the racism issue as you are.
Monero enthusiast here. Make me happy and call me a liar again.
OMG the bra hanging out of the back of that dress is so cringe.
No way! I never would have made that connection lol
"Maybe, that’d be sick. But ya, I really doubt it."
Is your brother incel? Is your dad upset you came out ugly?
We sacrifice them both to [NAME] and throw them in the Baler!
"This is seriously disturbing. Even more disturbing, is that we aren’t doing anything about this, and it’s going to expand. Watch. "
"The reaction is incredible. I’m quite certain it’s satire as well, but its impact is depressing as hell. "
Not sure to downvote because genuine and encouraging or to upvote because sarcastic and hateful.

So THIS is what it's like to have a seizure when listening to self control...
"We lap up the bitter tears of misguided young men, some weird stuff in here."
This is a rough sport we follow. Simply training makes you pay the price.
"I get what you mean but still that's like mixing ammonia and bleach, it's not gonna go out well."
Sounds pretty typical from Toyota really. Been hearing the same story from too many people. Sad really because they were always the best.
"Yeah, all of their SB's have been really entertaining. Nothing worse than an SB like the Seahawks-Broncos from 5 years ago."
"> we get a minimum of $11 Wow that's pretty generous, no wonder people don't need to tip."
Hell yeah. Enjoy your new bachelor life son!
"Exactly, or they thought he was saying it jokingly. The delusion these men live with continues to amaze me"
"They make it difficult to chant this, they go and get indicted way too soon."
What?! They must have thought they were at Disney.
Why is it arrogant to think LIVING IN A FUCKING BEAR CARCASS is wrong?
"He was just trying to sit down I think. Poor guy, doesn’t deserve all this shit from reddit."
Stop. How can you watch [NAME] these past years and think he has 2-3 years left.
That's really interesting! I've seen that happen before too
"Yeah I don’t even know when that would’ve come up in basic, but maybe I just went at a bad time lmao."
If he doesn’t give it a ten I’m gonna riot
That'd be fun! Meet at a bar and watch the show!
Eso me cae bien. I was just thinking that contending to make the playoffs in a few years was a depressingly low goal.
NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE NIKE Those leggings lmao
"I mean... It's about average. So not $200 but not ""throw it in the trash"" either. "
It's a photograph with one of our greatest ever defender and captain. What's your problem?
I don't define myself by my sexuality. Conservatives who want to kill me do.
Score is currently 12-12 when 25:th round begins and [NAME] has 35-10 stats. Insane.
"Really!? I thought it had, or at least it should. Guess I'm better off leaving too"
I love the immediate cut from the gladiator dying to the defeat screen. Makes it funnier
>it seems everyone is doing that now and I hate being One Of Those Women™. Wait- can you unpack this a little for me?
"Wow, that's incredible. I love the 4 quadrants idea! But the name of the business is so misleading..."
It's tasty. Had one on bone marrow once. I've had weirder things before
"Yes and that is very intimidating for me, hence why I need help"
>Ultimate 12 Inch *notices bulge* *OwO what's this?*
"My dosage was increased 2 weeks ago and I've noticed the issues getting worse. With your comment, I'm really leaning towards them being side effects."
Clearly I need to run for President so that I can blame all of my failures on my run for President.
They were my favorites. Players apparently hated them though.
People requesting asylum are not illegal immigrants so that argument is bull shit. Get informed by an actual news source please
Broooooo Just cause I can use my PC to play Earthbound doesn’t mean I don’t want it on my TV
I think it's insane how they reach out and then ignore. My ex does that. It gets on my f n nerves.
So you're saying the penalty for DUI is the same as texting and driving? Because that's what I've been saying it isn't true.
"Yeah, at this point I just keep of off anything remotely related to what Im playing/reading, its just too easy with the internet these days too be spoiled"
Oh no! People will be able to protect themselves!
I don't even know. Fyi I have this disorder that made me even antisocial day by day...
I only like felicity when she’s with black siren.

"Oh my [NAME], thank you. I thought I was going crazy for a moment."
"yep. And there are jobs I still would want done, they just shouldn't be government"
Conservatives never believe a word they say. They only believe they do.
Typical Lebronsexual garbage channel. Don't watch video.
"Thanks man. We had a taste of the storm Thursday. In South Central PA, we are all ready for the shit to fall."
"Yep. This sub is just being overly reactionary, which surprises no one."
That's a huge shame and says more about Sacks than it does anything else.
Did you really just link a study about partner violence and then equate that to the entirety of violence? Holy shrimp.
Im sorry my friends money should be out soon then ill release for all to see
"Aww man this sucks, but at least he’s going to Europe, so I’m happy for him! Goodbye [NAME]! "
"I think the saddest thing here is that he thinks ""by-my-self"" is how to write that."
The percentages Apple wants for membership have made many companies pull their apps. Seeking must feel it's not worth paying Apple.
Chills. I can’t wait. I’m sure [NAME] will get over this not being happy because they have bigger fish to fry.
I aint going back. This is going turn [NAME]” to “unconditional love” big facts.
What's worse is using self destruct without the pilot DLC. You just die :(
"Tell her to stop being so fat, then. Edit: /s"
"These stupid fucking cunts don’t even use “shade” correctly, [NAME] would toss them off the pier."
"errrrrrrrrr that's pointless, and your Doctor I'm afraid is pointless as well."
Censoring criticism and discussion is a very slippery slope.
"You're late, I'm not paying for those"

"I think that's a minority, not the majority there."
I’m so happy for you! Keep doing the damn thing! :):)
Another year filled with Mets disappointments...... LGM! Can't wait for Spring Training!
Buncha people having (admittedly loud) fun. Don’t really see the issue.
And I’ll admit I am insane for allowing it to happen but the passion I have for this guy makes it hard to cut off all contact.
I'm not falling for this again Uncle [NAME].
"Wow, never knew about [NAME] and I thought I was well-read!"
[NAME] was actually wrong all along. JAH > Jokic /s
"This guy is bigger than [NAME], maybe. But I've never heard of him."
"It was a few years ago now, I’m afraid I don’t have it or I would."
He will rest easy knowing how happy he made all of us
The last message was particularly painful to read
Uh no. He hates [NAME]. Not in A kayfabe way. He doesn't like [NAME] at all.
The aints can lick my bum hole.
"Already have one of those, mate :) just looking for a good replacement so I can continue using my [NAME]"

Pretty nice to see CONCACAF signing for the CPL.

"That's what everyone says but they are ugly. I want a Diavel, m109, or a Vrod."
You can disagree with the West's policies and past actions without aligning politically with authoritarian regimes.
"No, that's Generation Z. Instagram is their fault."
"Ah, modern society's obsession with romance for the sake of romance… I hate it."
Because no one in this world wants to see you happy and satisfied man!
When you glossed over [NAME] history to make a cheap shot at a democrat. That type of dishonesty is kind of your trademark
What an immature response. With a little passive agressive racism to boot. Classy.
So happy for you I am crying too.
"As someone with sinus and breathing problems, this makes me anxious and short of breath just looking at it."
"I mean, this very post is climate change denial related, which has zero to do with the second amendment, so I don't get your point "
Yep. I'm glad I never did. I'll gladly use their service for free when it suits me and give them nothing in return
So close to that dudes nether bits. Perfect
"[NAME], “How dare you show concern for the wounded!” Made me chuckle."
I think I saw some eyeball flying!
"This whole ordeal seems entirely pointless, but i don't want to turn away in case i miss some drama"

Even on steroids of all kinds in high doses there is no way that this is done in 16 weeks
"Deathly afraid, the undersides of boats too. I can't look if I see them in a picture or movie"
[NAME]. Gave up in October and haven’t looked back. I can’t believe how easy I’ve found it.
Because prostitutes clearly can't be raped or kidnapped. It's so horrifying that our society still believes this.
I'm glad none of you are GM
Go pursue that education. Let [NAME] wallow in her own sadness.
Get outta here and delete your post cause you're sure gonna look dumb in front of a lot of people other than me.
All i see is a guy that’s fine stealing beats from his own farm
That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
The comment thread is a hot mess and wouldnt be out of place in 2016. How do things not change....
I thought chiropractors were bad! Look as these medical doctors who were pushing opiates on their patients by the thousands!
"I personally find it very funny how they talk about vaccines not helping against cancer, while there isn't even a vaccine against cancer"
I'm glad they called it. Basketball is so dumb in that it's one of the few sports you're rewarding for committing a penalty.
"Was broken up with, still live together 2 months later, and probably will for another month. Studio apartment, 1 bed."
That sounds like a lovely time :D
Yea just went yesterday and the woodhaven area didn’t seem too bad. Seems very country for being only 25min from downtown.
"The only ignorant person here is you, and the Pope who makes the same baseless claims as you."

"[NAME], I thought we warned you about trying to collect ""data"" from this place."
"I don't even know how to begin explaining something this preposterously self-evident to you, so I'm just not going to. "
I would stay away from [NAME]. Apparently his injury got infected and will require more surgery/surgeries
"Its very obvious to me he is still in love with her. He is definitely not in love with [NAME], the marriage will be a disaster."
This is what I'm currently dealing with and I'm glad I read this. Nice reminder thank you lol.
"I made one comment, and you came in to call it childish..... like, what else are you doing besides badgering?"

I cant think of anything funny to say so upvote to give me free karma
"No you shouldn’t. If you recieve income, it should be taxed."
That's your justification? You're a terrible person. Correction: You're a terrible child. Get some help.
She has naturally chubby cheeks that are set on high cheekbones. I've seen it before and it's not abnormal.
Not sad enough fo here the skeleton is dead so he can't comit sucide
Liberals have become the very thing they accuse everyone else of. Being intolerant and racist.
If he feeds the RBs and designs some QB fakes that actually fool defenses I’ll be happy with everything else
I am surprised Facebook can't detect a non mobile device and redirect to the normal page.
"Whoa, we need animal safe verbiage! Don't feed a fed horse."
I’m glad to see [NAME] finally get the big screen presence they deserve.
And it's been drummed into them since birth that not working = lazy bum/death and homelessness.
"My god it is, dont forget the 2.50 innocent smoothies too"
"Horrendous , this is also reflected in my experience act school where you are not allowed to defend yourself at all "

The guy on that wouldn’t let [NAME] touch his own boat
I guess I am totally alone but I am really enjoying the audiobook and haven’t had a single complaint. I’m half way through now
Wow I never noticed that either before you pointed it out
I’m very happy for you! Congrats! 😁
"Man, she must really hate infertile women. "

"They are dangerous AF. I had a student faceplant and break her face, and my daughter's friend hit his head and is in a coma."
Break ups are painful and there’s no way to avoid that. Be honest with your current girl and end it.
You’d be surprised how often that works though
You could even say that they don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band.
Exercising. Yoga. Meditation. Walks out by myself. ( walking meditation) Good friends. Time with good friends.
"What an awful video. I just wanted to see the jump in real time, not 10 cuts of the start, followed by 1 slomo finish."

"Thanks for this gootecks but unfortunately this sub is a bunch of casuals that won't appreciate it, I'll see you in the SF sub"
Hey mods... let's not allow articles pushing unsubstantiated rumour from poor sources
I'm working on it. But there is always the fear lurking around....
After all that i expected it to not look terrible. Oh well.
"Ah damn, I forgot the /s, a AAA company would never put out a half-finished game. Good catch"
Part of being an adult is putting awkward on the back burner because some things are more important and need to be said.
I can't describe how that makes my stomach feel
Conversion to make gay people straight. It's horrifying
"Yet, his recoveries on attacks are abysmal."
Oh [NAME] this is atrocious... I think I'm in love
So wtf can I do then ? All the killers I was good with I suck with now and ruin is cleansed way too damn fast anymore .

Makes you wonder about the superbike which was going even faster..
I hear she eats babies on Sundays. (The rest of the week she goes easy and just punches puppies)
Omg yes kaede pure and soft must protect
1k followers on Twitter. Seem to have no sponsors. Not looking good
I agree. This is the real reason why I hate wearing pretty clothes and makeup. It's like putting lipstick on a pig.
That is pretty small damage. I wouldn't fix it either.
I have a bad one but I also have mild cerebral palsy on my left side
im not happy with tonight either but no need to make a bad situation worse by just bitching about everything and anything.

The characters and story are really enjoyable. The dungeons are awesome. Generally decent sidequests. Fun items. Cool art style and character designs
I legitimately want to brutally murder this person for saying that about us autistics
I kinda love it. Not sure what the theme of the party would be but... its cool.
Exercising. Yoga. Meditation. Walks out by myself. ( walking meditation) Good friends. Time with good friends.
So basically what we have is a horribly exploitative business model meant to prey on drivers by tricking them into accepting unprofitable rides.
Thanks man! That feels good to hear. I’m glad someone is on my side and finally understanding how I feel about this season.😄👍
So smart it looks like he shut his fingers in the door. That’s a nasty bruise under his fingernail.

It would probably make inequality between countries worse though over a long term.
So now disabled people don’t have rights . You get worse .
Haven't printed a retraction in twenty years!
I’m also glad I’m not the only one that swears a lot at the bastard objects.
Neither are foreign coups set up with the countries chamber of commerce and the head of the army.

Seriously! Like can any foreign power just come in and appoint a president?
"Kinda surprised he listed [NAME] and [NAME] in particular, but not [NAME]. I guess this is the Leafs spotlight working in real time here."

That's a weird way of spelling Disenchanted
[NAME] has not played under [NAME] for a single day of his career.
Not ok. They could have easily given them a drug test if they really wanted to know if they were on drugs. Disgusting.
It is an absolutely horrible ultimate I agree after 400 hours on doom I still hate it
But balance does not include the dark side
"Now we just need to kill [NAME] if [NAME] wasn't saved to really even the odds with her, similarly to [NAME] with [NAME]. "
That is not the typical sexual dynamic in western cultures. That's a crazy asshole.

It is part of the political game unfortunately.
I don't have children yet so I will just have a long conversation with my balls tonight
I'm so bad playing solo! I guess I need people to help me improve.
Young [NAME] works to hard for his name to be slandered like this.
I hate to say this but I love the drama around this all.... idk. My life is boring
It's actually illegal to do this. Only allowed if absolutely unavoidable.
I still think hating [NAME] isn't a good move for them. Could turn those undocumented [NAME] into undocumented [NAME].
"Ignore him, he is a spiteful little rat who is mad because someone did something good and it reminds him how pathetic he is."

"Yawning at the insults to me, not the Woman"
Oh gosh that's no good! Perhaps the other options are better places to start
That’s part of why I hate porn so much - other than the exploitation of women

"Nah we love telling people to post hog, you're just making our day better."
This is how far the Broncos have fallen. They no longer command the best and the brightest. Now it's .500 retreads. This should be concerning.
No worries. Just didn't see them. My bad.
Not surprising since about 85% of all dating relationships end in a break up.
Me as [NAME] with shatter ready when I see [NAME] & [NAME] alone in the back line:
Guys a complete troll who has no idea about cancer or the physical pain it can cause. Move on and don’t give the cunt the satisfaction.
"We don't. That is exclusively a leftist thing, and you know it. "
I’m happy he made it and not [NAME]
"[NAME] fucking [NAME] are you done yet racist motherfucker, you’re not helping society"
"you are correct, but now it is over. and i cry"
He doesn't know who leaked it. The guy filming it isn't the same guy that leaked it.
They only really fought them in Al-bab and only reason turkey took al-bad was to split the cantons
"Sadly, I don't have insurance so unless I'm bleeding out I won't be getting medical help."
Did he just get fat? What caused him to fall off so much? It's amazing how quickly he flamed out.
Time flies when you're a semiprofessional quotemaker. I wonder what he's up to these days.
[NAME] type awkwardness that some thots go nuts for.

No guns = no gun violence! How come no one has ever thought of this before!

"Good lord. > STATISTICS ARE BAD, WE MUST RELY ON ANECDOTES!"
Talk about a fucking hot take. Quality shit posting from [NAME] (not you [NAME]).
"Well, it is generating them. It has a vector space (latent space) from which you can pick out a face."
Then leave him. You're not married and sexually comparability is a huge part of making a relationship work. Don't underestimate this my friend.
"I won't cry any crocodile pears for you, that's for sure."
At least [NAME] got to touch UFC gold. Not many people can say the same. In good company.

Because what you're doing is disgusting and an insult to humanity.

It happens way more than you think. People are repulsive.
Wow! This got far more real than I was anticipating.
Sorry to hear it man. Grief is the appropriate thing to feel. I hope she is happy in the afterlife. Peace be with you both.
Nice try hilary but you lost to those idiot minority
[NAME] and clutch free throws are arch Nemesis

BECAUSE THERE IS A SHUTDOWN ATTACHED TO IT! HOW DO YOU NOT GET THAT?
"I think you're mistaken, muscle memory is rather strong it would simply be a reflex"
"Considering the whining he did in our modmail, he may not realize this."
If [NAME] is lurking here it's probably definitely not good for his issues
Downvoting comments you don't like is your right.
I wasn't digging it and then [NAME] did her spiritual spacewalk. I almost walked out.
"I hate the argument too. It betrays and exposes the violent, primitive ape amygdala response that is most Human social interaction. "
Fuck taking the high road. If I’m [NAME] I’m blasting the officials when I speak to the media.
What law did they break? This is just another example abusing a system for profit without the necessary laws in place to protect people.
"This is definitely dumb, but they're not saying vaccines=crack."
Sex is not a right! Porn is not a right! Viewing naked female bodies is not a god damn civil liberty!

Wow first fight in a while where I don't want either dude to lose.
Yeah I don’t think [NAME] wants you to fuck my wife/his girlfriend anymore you cuck
Confirmation sounds really scary and sketchy. I can not not think about cults and rituals everytime...
This happened at my local Odeon last night. The amount of confused faces was kinda funny to watch.
that is the saddest damn yogurt ive ever seen
That sounds like a reasonable estimation. So what are YOU going to do? Because you can’t force them to treat you like real people.
"Yeah, empathy, a hell of a drug ;)"
"Wow, out of all of that, only one person mentioned helping parents because they loved their parents. SAD."
Politics in the KRG are some of the dumbest and most petty of the Middle East.

There's a difference between rights and law. Stop conflating the two.
"> You first. Really. I have. I reject both, but I can do it separately because they're not necessarily correlated beliefs."
Bad timing for [NAME] to say this just now.

No. Going to a competitive high school was harder and more stressful than all my adult endeavors combined.
"Exactly. We’re only here for the money, assholes. "
I forgot i followed this subreddit and now i'm having a meltdown
"I feel sorry for people that think Reddit (or even some random sub-reddit) is ""an international stage""."
This game is actually worse than I was anticipating and I knew it was gonna be bad
She said that? Wtf?? That's fucked up. I shouldn't be surprised. Hypocrisy is common with this bunch.
lol not bullying. Just a socially aware nerd complaining about how annoying most of my people are. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
"Yea I tossed that one on the pile as a insult to myself and likely many, many others. "
That seems crazy that you can't hit higher frame rates. I can hit 80fps consistent with a 1080. Something weird is going on here.
"This is a good point, thanks :)"
Hey mods... let's not allow articles pushing unsubstantiated rumour from poor sources
When we actually executed [NAME] system we were killing it
"Same. You all tried to save me, but I rewatched with the sound on and... I have regrets."
"Yeah fucking thanks, politicians back in the day."
I secretly hoped we would lose by like 70.. 35 is not enough
If only I could bake a cake...or do anything productive when I'm feeling low confidence. I just lay in my bed and stop moving.
"The light socket doesn’t provide any light, so it’s useless."
[NAME] seemed pretty pissed at himself for last game and kept saying at the end watching the film inspired him to go hit the gym
Sadly there's a good chance that you still need a car anyway because that affordable neighborhood will involve a one hour commute.
One dumbass who hasn’t watched Hereditary complaining about meaningless awards on the Internet means... eh. I lost my point. Go watch Hereditary
Had my suspicions but didn't want to mindread such a civilized honest actor.
OH MY GOD! The PTA has disbanded! Ahh! Ahh! AHHHHH •jumps through window•

"its admittedly shallow and petty but I love the saying ""libertarianism is astrology for men"""
Personal insults aren't allowed around here. 1 week ban for first offense.
I dont understand this personality thing? Most guys aren't that interesting but they will still end up with a girl.
Thank you.. Makes my heart happy that someone can appreciate this thread :)
"[NAME] is huge fucking liar, but you seem to like him."
"No, it means you have a problem with homophobia and paranoia. A big one. No pun intended."
"My reaction was a dejected ""ahhhh damn....."""

"""Ahyuck, did ya see that Baseball/Football/Basketball game last night"" <--- you, probably."
"Ah, i misunderstood what he was going for, sorry my bad"
I don't think this makes much sense for Sacramento.
Of course I might not like it because of where I am at I’m sure not all places are so horrid .
Any more comments calling me SWERF for caring about sex workers will be blocked and reported I s2g
Ironic if an alt-right nutjob finally makes the alt-right nutjob mods finally mod. Maybe even cruelty can only take so much piss in its coffee.
Tkachuk - Pageau - Stone is going to be our second line. Absolutely filthy.
"Not really. Also it’s Winnipeg, sorry we don’t have the population of Tokyo..."
This is the most high school post I’ve ever seen on this subreddit.
I hate losing to the Blackhawks like I love my wife: Intensely.

I don’t know anybody of 22 who gets 10 hours of sleep every night

Same thing with depression. It’s becoming a trend and I hate it
excuse me what the *fuck* was that
We knows mumps immunity wanes; is it possible for measles immunity to do the same thing? I'm kinda scared to try Googling it too.

Only Ten more minutes of watching [NAME] drop easy ass throws
"Weird, huh, how people always seem to look for ways to justify our per capita emissions. "

"All good man, I don't get the college football hate I see on here, and I hate the big ten disrespect I see everywhere. "
Oh my [NAME] I almost forgot about the hot dr pepper in a glass glass made of glass
"Wow, thanks so much for me to own tool that I can speak and understand Japanese fluently enough."
That's sad. You can be acquaintances with women. Not like you are driving them to the nail salon or something .
Can’t tell if you’re joking. But it’s called a habit.
No. I want to know why the law applies differently to her and how I can use that to my advantage
"If I ever see that in my area, that will be a bullet to the head. Fuck Reddit's rules."
Every day it gets harder to tell the difference between a legit mental health issue and someone just using it as an excuse to be an arsehole.
I guess nobody cares about what you want.
Peaky Blinders is the shit. I don't understand how there isn't more hype around this show.
I'm concerned with optimal health. Not surviving.

Help me [NAME] I'm bully in high school for no reason.
Three years ago I did! Ended up hospitalized for 5 days. I can say that I'm in a much better place now. :)
My shirt is [NAME]. My balloon popper is the DNC. And then [NAME] is the fire under my ass to dive deeper ever day.
This is so scary but I would love to go there. And it is actually in Brazil

it's so cold today I nearly cried just from the temperature and wind I DONT LIKE IT
Just thinking about all the stupid stuff I did as a kid makes me very afraid for my 5 year old.
"[NAME] living in y’all heads rent free lol. It’s kinda sad ngl. EDIT: Thanks for proving my point, guys 😘😘😘"
You can do that here dude. got a story? just tell it man
No. Without getting into spoilers that ring is reserved for something else later in the game.

You have to sneak up on the flame by approaching slowly.
"You are grieving a hard loss, and might benefit from some grief therapy."
So far she seems pretty decent but I'm side-eyeing the hell out of him. His conduct at the restaurant was so bizarre and creepy.

"no, $950 plus enhancements. but with enhancements mine is better than the white Arabian was."
Players salaries are going up drastically every year. They’re hardly getting squeezed.
"I’m so sorry for your loss, I’ll drink a few extra for your fiancé"
that's not split pushing. split pushing is literally pushing 2 lanes at once.
Too bad [NAME] is a bad person if abandoned and tries to kill you as well. Her singing was really nice..
Well it doesn't matter anyway. Ignore compliments; they don't help you.
The new movie doesnt even look very good honestly
I don’t think anyone would be offended by calling a group guys. But idk
It's always been Marfeles. Was 30 years ago when I first visited.
"Nope but here you go. Honestly really disturbing, don't say I didn't warn you."

Sadly the Request a Book of [RELIGION] requires a phone number now. But if you have theirs it might work;
Yeah the lack of visibility of the survey likely means the survey is gonna be skewed towards people who are extremely online on this sub specifically.
I still miss the north hills bottom dollar :(
"Yeah, I don’t trust them either. "
As a society we should be ashamed of the fact that this is even a question. Let the suffering stop obviously.
Weird that a movie star is dating a hot young model?... like what’s weird about that
Also seem not there any fighting games in this tournament...
"Yes, it can be a very stressful read at times."
I'm afraid if I have a awful time or something like that I'm going to get worse..
That’s sex discrimination. The male class has their own bathrooms but the female does not.
please don’t make me have to bring up fire emblem in trader joe’s again i can never go back
"No, sex is a reward, and he doesn't deserve it."
That's a very long winded way to say 'i disagree'
The argument [NAME] is making is that expecting women to cook is considered sexist but expecting men to shovel snow is fine. It's about the double standard.
The mouth coming out of the plate is the most unsettling. At least I think that's a mouth.
So what I'm hearing is your dad didn't do a good job ~~brainwashing~~ raising you :-P
"I won't cry any crocodile pears for you, that's for sure."

It's all fun and games until your crush turns into a spaceship.

Unfortunately if you’re looking for game info about the Detroit Basketball team your in the wrong sub.
Came for the murderino and stayed to say I drive like [NAME] a lot and it’s bad lol
No way!? Ugh this just sounds painful
They are so old and so predictable that they can NOT see how “silly” they look when they post articles like this......
Shut up about the sun! SHUT UP ABOUT THE SUN!!!
"in the words of [NAME]: As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it. Had to give you a career to destroy it "
"I failed with my play on words. Oh well, can't win them all"
One can only hope this is the worst issue you ever have to deal with in life. Sheesh.
"In this view, you claim to wield power over them, and are clearly no anarchist. You are implicitly advocating for hierarchy."
Ooh! Ooh! I want to lose more than 5-10 vanity pounds! (...wink wink)
I’m so sorry you are going through this. Sounds like an awful experience.
And yet nobody bat an eyelid when it was [NAME] who was palling around with [NAME]. I wonder why.
And sock puppets. Wow. Nothing out of you is in good faith.
Do not use logic dude. Not cool.
It's actually illegal to do this. Only allowed if absolutely unavoidable.
They are too busy getting murdered and mugged to give a crap about all these vigalantes
My dad doesn’t believe in climate change. This is way too accurate.
D'OH! Right in front of my face and I missed it
"Lost my kid to the system, wanna see wha the wee lassie has tae say"
Omg my 3yr old kept rubbing it all over his face the other day too!! 😆
I will never forgive and never forget for this one
Stumbling out of a closet in full [NAME] outfit... I'm afraid it's not
And butt. I can't believe butt cracks are blurred in US shows!
"1-2-3-4 I declare a thumb war! Dangit [NAME], you win again! Ok you get to stab me again :("
I just want to die. I don't want to keep trying.
Fuck you for making me read this.
Damned asshole trouble maker!! Someone has mummy issues. 👀
Well this all started Wednesday. But I’ve been unhappy with my life for weeks now
>he definitely doesn't value my pleasure this is very sad
"Either way, it's at the very least not an ethical way to conduct business."
Wow so glad [NAME] is getting it done quicker. Better for later in tourney
Wooah :o Didn't know [NAME] had a son xD
I gave the show a chance because I enjoyed Bad Education. AP Bio is pretty bad compared to it. Hopefully season 2 improves.
He can’t be like that in that business but it already sounds too late. No wonder his staff quit on him.
I love rock music but I enjoy draft punk too.....*feels bad man*
They were not [NAME] and they don't know the identity of them !
Am I the only one that wants to see your art?? I love calligraphy! You might have a client here!!
She tried playing the “I know a secret” game during the hearing. It blew up in her
The fact she'd want her daughter with someone as awful as [NAME] is strange. And what's wrong with [NAME] that she would stay with him ?
Ok so the scape goat is gone. No more excuses now [NAME].
BP can bulwark counter A good number of deflects and even drop attacks We have more than that to worry about
I kinda love it. Not sure what the theme of the party would be but... its cool.
"Im glad you took that step. Sometimes its really hard making that decision, but im glad you didnt force yourself to be miserable"
Not complain. She could not complain since she made no effort in the beginning.
i luckily became really good friends with one. we definitely helped each other process our pain from him... so surreal how well they spin those lies
Definitely surprised we took out [NAME] there. We needed to finish the quarter strong and it went straight to shit when he left.
"[NAME]? Nah, that's him in the background. The idiot with the leaves is [NAME]. It's always fucking [NAME]."
It's a loooong story with some awkward weirdness haha
That’s the most badass joke I’ve heard
I've always hated the 610/45 interchange. Everyone slows to a crawl when there is no need to slow down.
Oh boy I was wide awake when I lost my under 51.5. [NAME] can go fuck his ugly self
"Unfortunately they do at times, but it's not the case in this video."
Doesn't suck nearly as bad as Metropolitan Grill. I'm surprised that place is still open.
This is horribly disgusting. It's worse than the god damn chicken wire.
Great fucking game for [NAME]. And I can't believe some people are trying to hate on him for one TOV in the 4th. This fan base smh
This is the kind of thing that makes me want to move away far into the mountains away from civilization.
And what a fuckton of karma it was. It’s fake stories like this that really prove that communism is the far superior economic system.
Every day in everyway. If I am to happy with anything next thing I know I'm actively destroying it.
Most GH now is fake. The real stuff is exorbitantly expensive.
Now I’m crying before work thanks a lot 😭
Oh no! People will be able to protect themselves!

"You were really fortunate! See, that’s what I imagined would happen... "
"I'm on the receiving end of a breakup, and i'm not handling it well. So cheers from Germany!"
"I would pay money for [NAME] to not be my nurse. She will probably ""accudentally"" squeeze my nuts. Crazy bitch."
I'd punt her to another planet if she said that about my dog. Wtf is wrong with people. 😠
"I thought she got arrested over it, but charges were dropped?"
Hey man. A lot of people have criminals in their family. That doesn’t mean they are I think you need to take a step back
"""I refuse to argue with anyone born before 1980: They don't even know how to rotate PDFs"" That is exactly how this stupid argument sounds"
"It's creepy but also sad that the guy was bathing in your fountain, hey at least it wasn't your pool. "
I saw one that us taking Greedy William's at 6 with the Jaga taking [NAME] at 7 lol. Cllelin ferrel was at 4
> male person should be romanceable > of course this requires the protag to be female Found the [NAME].
"Nah, I don’t care what these people think. As soon as I’m nauseous, I leave"
I don't think this happened at all tbh
"i'm not that into shower sex tho. like it's fun sometimes, but it takes me so long to get off when i'm wet."
"I'd hate to see the [NAME] be reduced to a drunk junker. You know, like REYS parents are. "
"Marginal taxes was taught in my high school economic literacy class, it's so sad that so many people don't even understand the basics of our tax system "
"Just recked him, totally and utterly. "
"No, but even if you did, you'll find nothing special."
Bless this woman. That honestly sounds horrific from every end. I hope her ex [NAME] has lived a horrendous life since perpetuating that disgusting act.
Nice try hilary but you lost to those idiot minority
I enjoy fixing problems. I think of it as a task that I can achieve. People get to overworked when they set too unreachable goals.
That they don't work for everyone doesn't mean they are a scam.
"The no rape was my favorite part, so glad people agree"
"I’ll be honest, I didn’t expect that to be real"
Was at wreck beach yesterday a guy was masturbating around kids family etc just sitting next to a log...
"Nasty, nasty, nasty... Really *can't* understand why she is a 300lb human. s/"
It could have been worse! All the chairs and table are still upright.
I've never been there before so I can't confirm or deny but I would be really surprised if a casino only had limit holdem
Anyone else see her 10 year challenge post today or yesterday. I'm so shocked she wouldn't pick this picture.
"Wait, I see the problem, you are changing the word observation to assumption, which I think you know is disingenuous."
I’m glad to see [NAME] finally get the big screen presence they deserve.
Hooray! ...But I'll still never be able to afford a home.
"That’s exactly what it says on the menu, don’t see what’s wrong here."
"Yea, so you need to leave him. Clearly not great in the ""protect your loved ones"" situation. "
You should've smashed his head into it.
"[NAME] fuck I know this feeling for academics though, not sports."
You should find that for us. Also normally higher profile guys like [NAME] don't actually participate in the senior bowl
And? Abusive people apologize sweetly too. Doesn’t make them any less aggressive and in the wrong.
It’s crazy that people know this and yet rake [NAME] over the coals for not wanting to talk to [NAME].
Mate it's been nice the last couple weeks. You're gonna die when a stormy period arrives.
Some rambling paragraphs about what a waste I am and how sorry I am to be a disappointment to those around me and that sort.
All of their Saints are psychotic idiot who died for nothing. People remember them as horrible people in death as they were in life.
Woah... I'm shortsighted and I can get 2 pairs of glasses for €149. $500 is insane!
"I don't see how a NBC journalist's departure is relevant to the SCW, especially since he didn't cover Syria on the ground."
I just love the look of most benzos. Bars of course the most. But a handful of 10mg valiums or 2mg klonopin is also mouth watering :)
It's one of my most hoped-for things. I think you should be able to approach a player and request a duel. It would be sick
Worrying about [NAME] during a game is ridiculous. Especially when he's currently 6-11 from the field.
What happened to [NAME]? I haven’t followed closely but I was under the impression he wanted to return but the club wanted to move on
"Yes, I filed for a protective order. Other than that, there is no happy ending with a narc."
This is the first time I’ve ever been reposted. I’m honored
"The trouble is that they are, in fact, very devout [NAME]. "
This movie is highly underrated. Part of the problem it has is that Rogue One was SO FREAKING AWESOME!
Glad she's not living in a bubble then....
Sounds like a great idea that your nephew is moving away from her. She’d be an absolutely toxic mother.
I took a marijuana doobie this evening around 5:00 p.m. after my dinner at Country Kitchen Buffett and I am now tripping.
"I was tested for the flu on Saturday and it came back negative, but yea it probably is a cold or something "
Jazz too i remember the office and pnr talk about how bad it is.
Yes absolutely extreme levels of anxiety reaching the sheer terror phase tbh. People have no idea what I go through
No I dont think I said that anywhere
"The sound ISN'T mixed terribly like in high school kids and a nice taxidermised bear in the USA, a beautiful day!""."
"Im turning 30 this year. We just cant get rowdy like we used to man, i mean we *can* but damn all these responsibilities"
Yes. Half the posts on this sub are about posing. I think the pose she is pulling is ridiculous too...
I hope there is a special place in Hell for these people.
Give me $100 and I'll text you something fun. Sounds like paid sexting to me.
Sure hope #4 includes subsidized housing. I'm terrified.
Omfg the worst!! want to pull my hair out!!
Happy Daily Peko #270! Source couldn’t be found I think it’s from the manga.
"That was difficult, but not impossible, to masturbate to."

I stopped worrying about showing vulnerability years ago but there's still nobody there.
"I was already taking a break from basketball this season, but I think this really put the final nail in the coffin. This team is hopeless. "
Serious creep vibe when she put on the wedding dress.
You are a disgrace to the species
"Nobody consciously thinks ""today I feel like chewing with my mouth open""."
I can't imagine buds being very hard to find in Hawaii
yeah but we really don’t want to be like them. it is an example of failed communism turned militaristic authoritarianism
And to think all along I was wondering if it was left hand turn day or just me!
Not sure if you're joking. Not sure if I disagree. But since the point of high school is daytime teenager containment google would not accomplish that.
wanna high key low key high key slide into [NAME] DMs even though I'm literally distraught at him and [NAME] separating
Ya done goofed kid. All you had to do was win.
"You've been a sad boi around here for the last week straight, you'd do well to take a break."
"Thanks, dude. It means a lot : ) Hope you have a great week."
i once dipped a raw hot dog in chocolate pudding when i was dared too. it was dreadful.
John Oliver is a fucking liberal pig.
Need turtle for the 3peat squad It’s crazy they were 1 team and now they are 5 :( I hope all of them can make playoffs
"We had the chance, but never made the offer last year."
Did you just call me a *bitch*?? You will NOT disrespect me like this TODAY!
They have directly targeted civilians. It's disgusting.
"Yup, it all starts with [NAME]. He’s not the worst owner in the nfl, but he’s in the bottom half for sure. "
I can't do that....I don't know how to hard boil eggs sooooo
It's incredible how much pain a single reddit post can send through my body
Devils fan here: how good is [NAME]? I'm watching this game and was wondering how he's been and what his potential is
"Nope, nope, nope and HELL NOPE! "
"hahaha, this is great. We need more anarchist jokes."
Calling people on the internet “sweetie”... sweet [NAME] I love this sub. The cringe hurts so good.
Same thing with Urgot mid. It looks absolutely trash even in LCK.
What? I didn’t understand a thing of what you said.
I bet she smells like a jar of mayo left open for a week in the summer
"Basic translation ""I'd rape you if I weren't a virgin!"" Super creepy."
"You thought wrong. Also, the answer is Caribbean Splash Car Wash on Clarksville Pike. I'm not even kidding."
Things were significantly worse back then than they are now.
OMG I totally forgot about that episode. What a nightmare
"says you, too bad you're totally wrong."
Nobody is shaming them for trying to stop article 13. Youtube is being shamed for being hypocrites.
the rubber coming off is always a problem
I’m not going to live in the middle of nowhere. I like Chicago.
"It shouldn’t say that, because it is not single payer "
There's doing stupid things when you're young. Then there's doing horribly stupid things when you're in your mid-30s and you're already active in Politics

So happy for your strong stance and to help him on his way out of your life.

Cali is getting rain this weekend so going to miss that

Yes no one wants to believe my religion and how to make people happy so it makes me sad
Passing the torch. Lmao. You never made a good one.
"Ridiculous. That kid didn’t do anything. Just stood there and smiled, while waiting for his bus. You’re crazy."
Like I said please have a great day !
Wow she said that? Let me just #red flag

"Wow City all of a sudden not so invincible anymore, have as many defeats as us now..."
"ITT: People saying ""I'm doing to get downvoted for this"" and then not getting downvoted."
That guy’s an asshole. He behavior doesn’t inherently have anything to do with poly.
"So, [NAME] and [NAME] are over? Have to wonder why he thought marrying a 19 year old was the best thing to do!"
[NAME] is also in a HEAP of financial and technically legal trouble right now. lol
"Haha yeah, apparently their ringleader just got banned on Twitter. "
but if it weren't that way then a corrupt police force could convict many innocents. there is no correct answer to this problem.
Kinda sad if that's what you got out of the ad lol
So? Keep doing it anyway. Who don't worry about the downvotes.

"I am now sad the latest Thief was so mediocre, because the actual City the game took place in was a great little world."
"I mean that’s a stupid rule that creates an echo chamber, but I don’t see how that belongs here."

I'm so glad I grew up playing a shooter made for kids rather than a shooter made for kids.
Oh. My. [NAME]. I can’t handle this
Really disappointed it's not even coming digitally on Vita outside of Japan.
Not only Russia will use this technologie.
Yep that was incredibly rude. What kind of adult sits down and decides to put that in a major magazine? Just unbelievable.
I killed them for the first time in my most recent playthrough and regretted it. The replacement council sucks just as hard.
"What bothers me is not the fact that someone disagrees with my lifestyle, it's that they constantly go on and on about..that would annoy anyone."
I love the views from Red Road. Great photo.
No problem! I was upset I couldn’t chose a female rose grey bay Arabian in story mode. I wanted to name her Rosé
I hate these memes because [NAME] never cared if he did or didn't have a nose.
Kinda sad to laugh at people who really need serious help.
"Meh, the liga that we all knew and loved went away when [NAME] fled to Italy"
So you’re telling me you think [NAME] is better than [NAME] whatever you say man
I am just saying that it makes no sense in Russian
Uh . . . Uh . . . I'm not feeling so well.
Same. Gives me the attention and love feelings that humans have failed to give
Arsenal FC the retirement home... No thanks [NAME]
Sorry I'm a reddit noob but why do I get notifications of comments on my thread but then they disappear and I can't read them? Lol
Lol this fan base has the memory of a goldfish.
Because it would look worse than 2D art.
Voting for someone to tax you to death makes no sense
> to attract degenerates. You frequent r/The_Donald. What does that make you!!
"It’s so hard to be a mommy! Chasing kiddos. Work, work, work!!! "
"Doesn’t sound like it’s going to work out, sorry dude"
[NAME] - OT3 in my team without me... [NAME] - Sometimes bad things just happen...
Shit's going down in Zim. 6 people killed yesterday by army and over 200 arrested.

"I was expecting the surprise birthday, not seen this twist on the sister before. "
"It makes me uncomfortable for anyone to force physical affection on anybody, it doesn’t matter the age. "
There could have been men going that we’re not priesthood holders.
there are different levels of terrible. Supplying the PLO/Hamas with arms ranks prettttty damn high.
"Friend of the younger sister of girl who was killed. She told me it was a bad acid trip. Very sad, family is holding a vigil tomorrow night. "
Definitely not. It would be so boring to have no chance year after year.
Yeah how dare the puck not magnetize to [NAME] stick. Not his fault at all.
Yeah lazily typing a naughty word to some retard on the internet is a real indicator of being angry rofl
Dream market is also down for me in the USA
"So, the cops raided my favorite massage parlor today."
"Wow, really? I hope this kind of event doesn’t happen that often. "
"These guys are playing hard to get. Gonna take off my bra, BLAST MY NIPS!"
Cats are repulsive and they don't deserve to be pets
thats cool to hear ... [NAME] really is laughable in this regard
Actually nothing. The only thing is it's hard to brush while sitting down. I have to stand up.
What a bizarre way to normalize the psychological path to becoming a violent criminal.
I would say love is never enough. Love is unconditional. Relationships are not.
"Fuck, my wife and I spent less than a *fifth* of that. Wow. "
😂 MIL would never have the self awareness to understand the double meaning but I think it's hilarious
"Ridiculous. That kid didn’t do anything. Just stood there and smiled, while waiting for his bus. You’re crazy."
Surprised Greece doesn’t see [NAME] as their own. I mean he’s not from Greece but still Greek.
I am not saying that I think many of the latest disputes my husband and i have had ours for a little while longer.
"""PPG Paints"" arena or whatever it's called now is worse"
"DoorDash can deliver my White Castle's at 3am, that makes me happy"
My only deal breaker would be possessiveness like it is for men bc I only like dating

They typically go bad before use. I can buy a plastic banana!
"I didn’t like him before this, now I really don’t like him. "
I feel bad for all those kids whose parents decided to homeschool them so they could be professional HOTS players without all that stupid learning getting in the way.
It was salt. This is the laziest ‘dish’ I have ever ordered in my life.
That is an exceedingly rare failure. I read an article about this guy. He was just stupid and stopped there.
That’s horrible. You definitely didn’t deserve it. I’m glad to hear you’re doing OK now.
"Om [NAME], who kets their dog fight a croc? "
None at all. I dont like kids and dont want them. I got a vasectomy and it's a done deal. Zero regrets
Can you imagine being taken to court over a flushing loo? I can’t believe the courts are even entertaining this.
"Sorry man, I have no idea either! "
Omg so short but such a bop! I’m so excited for her album
No... There are many ways to prove you are [NAME]. I've heard of people that proved they are [NAME] by showing that their mother speaks Yidish.
"Idk, the Teen Mom subs are bad for this too. Really bad. "
"It’s lunacy to think that [NAME] is an actual Russian agent, since there’s literally no evidence of this."
We don't deserve you. Thanks for the update. Happy it's being handled! :)
Lets spare him his life from this monstrosity
Don’t let the bastards grind you down. I’m so sorry for this experience. No one deserves to be treated that way.
So you could say that this is one of very few subreddits that manages to somewhat avoid political spins and that the original commentor is a worthless shill
Wow they got them [NAME]? Those US agents are some lucky guys
I think you need a better partner. Continuing to go after you said you want to stop is kind of abusive.
"ah, it does me heart good to see NIMBYs in the wild"
"Your mistake, you should've waited outside, he just followed the app right to you."
I wonder if that child puts it on his resume.
Sorry but this is too rad to be cringe for me. This is like if [NAME] was a general.
""" [NAME] has come down with a terrible sickness which caused him to deactivate his twitter account"" Jeez sicknesses these days get worse and worse. "
I used to delude myself mine had dreamy eyes. Now I know it was the weed...
"""I CAN CLEAN MY OWN VAGINA NOW!"" Kills me every time. "
Indifferent before leaving. Indifferent after. Although hasidic [NAME] are fucking mental.
It's almost a shame we won't get a second leave/remain referendum because it would be fascinating to see the result.
"ha, hardly. maybe the biggest city. Russia is fucking huge."
It’s one of my worst nightmares to have skin like that...I hope that person gets actual help
I feel you. It's weird that we don't see [NAME] or [NAME] in the promotional stuff though.
Wow! You must have pretty low standards for teachers in your state/school! I guess that's why Massachusetts is always first for education.
Making a woman feel uncomfortable is harassment and trying to flirt without a sign of interest just makes women uncomfortable
"Turns out you can polish a turd. The trouble is, it's still just shit."
[NAME] that poor man just cut em off
"I'm strange as fuck, and I didn't grow up with money."
"I’m scared of shots, but I’m more scared of dying. What Anti-vaxxers are scared of is autism"
Yikes - I'm so sorry things fell apart for you and imposing a sudden hierarchy on you like that was completely crappy on their part.
"Lol what a terrific audience. Maybe rich people saying ""come beg"" is kinda like wtf bro."
"I think putting the slur in the title of the video and using it frequently is a little bit more than ""simply acknowledging"" it. "
Actually pretty surprised that they made it fit as well as this.
I hate Twitter more and more each day....the people on there are so toxic it literally makes me sick. They can't appreciate a good meme.
Would love to see them both in the same side
"If it's anything like what happened in France, I'd assume because it disproportionately affects the poor. "
"I'm not vegan cause I love animals, I'm vegan cause I hate myself. "

"I don't live there anymore, but I grew up in the midwest, and the ""ope"" triggered me a little bit"
Oh I didn't know. Please give me his P.O. Box address so I can submit them immediately. Cause I am definitely uninterested in blowing out my intestines.
Lucky for me the yellow ones are my favourite
So how depressing is it that I know that's not true? You still gotta pay for a cold delivery.
Wow they got them [NAME]? Those US agents are some lucky guys
She is still a billionaire. I guess stupid Tweets are going to bankrupt her?
I will happily convert to [RELIGION] if I can quit my job and have unlimited food. Please tell me how to accomplish this
Great place and they're super sweet. Happy to support them.
"Don't apologize for a joke,especially when its true."
Always funny how one's income has to pay for others expensive lifestyles ;)
"Wouldnt believe that much, surely rather stay and win the league first, cant blame him tbh"
This is an uninformed and incorrect statement. It doesn’t take even close to that long.
It's more like depression is the default state. We live in a depressing society.
Same. I felt like I haven’t found the “right” therapist. Hang in there and hug your little one tight!
Those are hoteps. They're delusional idiots; no one takes them seriously.
"In looking at the questions answered in the AMAs following the [NAME] podcast, I don't see any related to [NAME] or race/IQ. "
I don't remember being able to hear in those situations. I think...
"Downvoting because of a lack of funny, regardless of your clumsy attempt to insinuate that my doing so means I'm thin skinned."
"Yes!!!! Great weekend. As others have said, I can now enjoy the rest of the playoffs"
"Wow, I’m going to have to remember this one..."
Then keep your hands visible and fight the ticket in court. Don’t understand how this is such a complex issue.
I'm glad the republican won cause I want the best high I have had 5 back surgeries and need another.
I once overheard my grandpa telling my brother that “anything more than a handful is a waste”
"Wow look at this deep pockets eating a lentil a day, I have to slice mine to last me a month!!!"
it's hurting my heart :( why did you leave me
"No more [NAME] from Georgia. Suck it you old, ugly hag."
I am so sorry to hear about your wife’s tragic injury.
That helps. I would've never guessed you'd style mannequins.
Your friend should be disowned by their family
My coffee burned its way through my nostrils. Thank you!
It makes sense to me. I am a republican in that sense but hate the GOP for the most part.
"Huh, I was just wondering if something like this existed. I'm working in food manafacturing an this would be epic."
i didnt call him an idiot. His fanboys are idiots that feel smart by hanging on to every word he says. He's definitely sexist tho
"Glad he's still balling, better than [NAME] for sure. I would have liked to have kept him just cos I liked how hard he played. "
I like The Office but this seems a bit weird.
"Omg, the hands touch the chicken, go off screen and then touch the salt. My mind is contaminated with Salmonella. "
I really felt for this mother. You could tell how frustrated and exasperated she was. Glad she was there to stand up for her kids.
"We all saw it, my American friend. Now go and fix your government."
Now excuse me while I go home with my briefcases full of money from alcohol and tobacco companies
That's a pretty cool way to die.
**Lost** children. Issues we face today are likely fabricated from the bottom up.
Don't forget about the flooding in Houston. :/
This is just such an obvious troll.
Sorry if this has been covered a bunch but what happened on the play where [NAME] got injured?
Getting tougher to make those mortgage **and** car payments.
Half right I am 15 but I’m not a goth and just enjoy the taste of human mostly blood but flesh is almost as good
I'll look into it! I don't mind language but misogyny can be pretty intolerable
Not any weirder than male doctors handling women junk for centuries.
Don’t explain how you’re feeling to her either. Women like men who’s feelings are unclear.
"> You have no shame. This is just more Ad Hominem FFS! You really can't help yourself, can you? "
"Yeah I was super surprised by how good Trench was, probably my top album from last year"
Oof. This physically hurt me to watch.
This is like the timeline from hell.
"Indication of questionable parenting perhaps. Encouraging this reaction seems a bit tacky. Not respectable, if we're truthful here."
TSA agents are like tow truck drivers. Everyone hates them.
Keep going man. I’ve been enjoying reading your posts. All the best!
I’m the most surprised that [NAME] is 35. Seems like just yesterday he was plotting with [NAME] on how to get booze for the party
U can try. Maybe say u are busy now Thursday but Friday is still open. I mean u are not waiting for her forever right?
It isn't incorrect to use 'they' even when a person is explicitly a women/man.
Don't get down. You have only ruined it with that one person.
"I trust [NAME] in getting us the people we need, but I don't trust [NAME]."
Thank you for the specifics! Really helpful. Glad you’ve found such a good mix for you.
Lmao I have like 12 days played cop farming who even does that anymore oh my [NAME] you’re pathetic for even bringing up ages
I couldn’t believe my ears. she’s unbelievable.
Good thing I don't give a shit.
I’m currently doing a 3 day fast and omg this is not helping 🤤
Seriously. The only thing that gave it away was no spelling errors.
I don't know how long I should wait or if its even a good idea. Im so co nfused
Mate imagine reacting so poorly to be called out to calling anyone who has been discussing ozil and sven unreasonable.
"The ""[NAME] says it's true"" line makes me think he's messing with you."
“I’ll never have a playoff mandate” go fuck yourself [NAME]
Tears of happiness rolls down the eyes
"Ooof, I’m so sorry, that is rough."
"Same. More often than not, people don’t bother to wipe up their pee on the toilet seat."
"Teacher: Huh, I never though he'd really do that."
Disgusting of you [NAME] you filthy who're you pedophilic scum trying to beguile our children it's not gonna work I got [NAME] castorated
The comments under that video are disturbing. People actually see this as a sign of the end of times.
You sound like someone who doesnt know what ironic humour is.
Goddamn it Your username just started a song in my head 👶🦈
"It’s almost like a lot of Yankees fans are giants fans, and a lot of pats fans are Sox fans. So. Weird."
But then you regret it because you realize you secretly liked the attention. Just bottom things.
How dare you! Don’t you know seatbelts cause autism!
"omg, id cry if this was my store "
Every day it gets harder to tell the difference between a legit mental health issue and someone just using it as an excuse to be an arsehole.
"Unfortunately for you, no one of importance cares about your absurd views. "
Child labor laws are ruining this country
"My bad. I typo'd. It should have said ""how""."
No....no its not. Anyways thanks for being honest. I needed to hear it from someone else.
"I think they'd do ok (Sorry but as an INTJ a lack of my thoughts here is also bothering me, too)"
I was born in ‘98 so I feel like your ‘98 loss is my ‘09 loss.
Because you aren't serious. You're just mad because you got told to stop using slurs one too many times.
Well if you already bought them why throw them away? Use them up and don't buy anymore.
Because it's not mildlyinfuriating that you have to ask strangers to not be assholes?
these people are holding our country back. Im happy natural selection is taking its course.
Sign my name to it too lol it was so awful we deserve pain and suffering for that!
You’re probably recalling it correctly! It was maybe 2 years ago? Very ugly & sorted story
"I just watched this episode the other day. I was MORTIFIED. I like seasoned chicken, but not that kinda season no"
That’s horrible. I’m probably going to donate to them I can’t imagine not missing out on a season because someone stole.
Can't. Prequel bad. Bearded [NAME] Man idea bad. OT era only good thing.
"I’ve had a hard time finding stuff in the area, occasionally Construction Junction will have a decent old handsaw or two..."
Absolutely amazing how people think this is anonymous.
That’s sex discrimination. The male class has their own bathrooms but the female does not.
"Such dumbass,I think I'm going to take my dog somewhere else"
I constantly feel like I'm my husband's best friend and it's just a matter of time until we break up :(
Personally I'm wondering why our OP didn't go with the clone angle. That's way more insane than them just being sent to prison.
"I'm more worried about him scamming children than ""oNLY"" scamming them into thinking they'll get $100."
This shirt is directly aimed at some very ugly individuals
"Childhood is happiness. After that the rest of your life is spent chasing that feeling, a feeling that you’ll never experience again "
I'm too late to rub this into all the casual's faces. :(
This helped me when I was in my worst mental state. I'm glad
Talked with my parents. It was so relaxing and beautiful <√9 Thank you a lot ❤
But everybody got mad when Russia recognized [NAME] as US president. Go figure.
I completely agree! It's cold at first but makes you feel so alive and invigorated by it too. It's a total shock to the system.
I will never be able to comprehend that beautiful flick into a headshot hanzos seem to do.
Nay ye can't stop them. Have to let it play out and hope they don't throw a few curse words in there.

We're not really meant to be close friends and have sex with someone without feeling anything. You're defying nature by attempting to.
The sin was refusing to impregnate his brother's widow when [NAME] directly told him to. It's not just about wasting semen.
I’m sorry to hear that friend :(. It’s for the best most likely if she didn’t accept you for who you are

Look we are starving but we still have some honor. We don't need any help from your people. Especially not 50 cents a day
Another place Canada wins. That is crazy. There is basically no oversight on alternative medicine down here. Caveat emptor I guess.
I feel like its got to do with the bad desync in the game right now.
What...? That’s some real mental gymnastics to justify him assaulting her
And let us not forget the lord's privilege with a new bride. Ahhhh......the good old days.

"Yeah I was super surprised by how good Trench was, probably my top album from last year"

It is heated overnight at much cheaper rates. They are very well insulated.
"They've done this before. Look the Order of the White Feather up, it was worse."
"Wrong on so many levels. Just sit back and watch it implode. It will hurt at first, but guarantee, you will have the last laugh. "
I am mad that I did not come up with the Toewster.
It is part of the political game unfortunately.

Food stamps are a disgrace. People should get money!
"If being bisexual means I'm in a cult, I'm kind of pissed because I haven't received my cult robes yet."

I'm ugly and able to bump uglies with someone I can make laugh. Mission accomplished.
[NAME] was speaking as a man you idiots.
[NAME] stopped napping at 18 months. We’ve been implementing quiet time since. It’s wondrous.
I thought it was like a fake url sorry
Yep never understand why just because a move is small that makes it bad?
I don't even cook the steel cut! I just love the chewiness! I'm usually fuller longer with steel cut too.

"I should have known better, its obviously not a juul. I was just happy to see Oliver Tree tbh "
"[NAME] funny, girl.. not so much "
Try it sometime man. You may just enjoy it
So sad—but not surprising. It would be interesting to know if there’s a difference between countries with and without socialised health care.
Im just glad it didn't take any of that for us. I'm glad I didn't have to see a [NAME] screaming match
Even if it’s available 24/7 on your new website 99% of it is ugly so people still won’t buy it.
That’s gunna be a no from me dog
the act of using private companies as platforms to push indoctrination is no less vile than state run companies
I don’t like [NAME] in the slightest but I hate [NAME] even more. Get her Belcalis

"Eh, we all pay for sex one way or another. More power to you."
Plenty of Aboriginal blokes on here who criticised [NAME] too.
Some people have more/less empathy than others. If you're incapable of feeling what others are feeling you're going to be a selfish person.
Here in America too. Those counter protesting fascist get thrown in jail and pepper sprayed like animals. It makes no sense that this happens.
"I would not be that mad though. Just disappointed. I am angry at people like you, not the show in itself."
"That looks like before Fox even owned it, I was surprised to see it's almost been 30 years"
Because [NAME] doesn't have time to monitor what is going on in a couples bedroom.

"Yeah me, I'm blaming my medication tho."
"Good. It's weird that Polish gun culture is nearly non-existent, given their history as a country. Hopefully this is a step toward fixing that."
You nailed the crazy eyes. She scary.
Absolutely not. What if a girl did this to you? Instant turn off. She doesn't seem interested. Keep the communication face-to-face at this point.
Never thought I’d see a comrade here
I tried to send this to a friend but [NAME] knocked it away.
supposed to be brain ache but I am too tired with all these losses i have
Why do you guys hate [NAME]? I’m neutral leaning slightly positive on him. Just curious why the strong negative opinion?
How did this not get marked as meta? Tried posting something similar here and it was instantly flagged as “meta commentary about the sub” and blocked.
Taking a 2-0 in any WTA match is asking for a heart attack. Not necessarily bad though.

"With the weather we are having, it is a surprise when a battery works."
This makes me want Lancaster to be cannon! It’ll probably never happen though😥.
I picked up smoking again thinking it would aid that void that is working. It just made it worse.
"._. yeah, the man is doing something wrong if we feel nothing."
IANL I have never thought twice about doing a little extra shoveling to help a neighbor. Can't imagine that it could be illegal.

Not available in my country. Can't believe this has to be a thing in the modern age.
Your kind honestly need to fuck off out of Ireland. Nobody wants your dumb fucking antisemitism here

And the Reds. I subbed over at r/Reds after [NAME] went over there and their excitement at things actually happening fills me with envy
"You will watch porn again, don't try to fool me"
If [NAME] doesn't drop a [NAME] tribute tonight in his intro I'm going to be hella disappointed.
"I find that even when I wear a hat, I ""look [RELIGION]"" and get the same hate."
"Hahah I do live in Montreal, and you’re right. [NAME] damn it has been cold this week. "
Exactly hate when people try to spit facts when they don’t know if those facts are even right😂😂
"Also worth noting that OP was the racist, violent instigator in that situation."
[NAME] feel bad for ye no one can take a joke
I disagree. In that I believe that season 3 was also very good. I think it's better than season 4.
"The word ""YES"" has never erupted from my conciousness so fast before. I practically ejaculated it."
I'm so surprised they haven't done it yet tbh!
"Well unless you have an audio recording, people are gonna struggle to diagnose it for you any further I’m sorry. "
At least they didn’t destroy the shoes
"Lmao, okay little buddy. Have a nice day. "
I miss the [NAME] and [NAME] love story.
I remember writing on them was horrible. Slight delay which threw me off combined with the letters ending up looking like crap. Whiteboard was so much easier.
"Fuck it, im paying the premium -- 15% risk in not getting your money is quite high! "
I had so many bad Supercuts haircuts that I cringe when I look at the place and go to a fancy schmancy salon exclusively.
"Oh wow, that was a serendipitous ending! The weed saved her life. "

I'm a little disappointed that the tier markings werent' just different shades of green.
"Normally yeah but that was my friends first match ever and to encounter such a killer, who was running noed too is kinda disheartening for him"

i’m happy you were able to have a child! that’s my biggest concern.
I found some very interesting things on the mind shock podcasts about questions I had. Enjoy the digging in the reddit hole.
Why would they stop magicking away their shit. That seems more practical than a giant plumbing network.
[NAME] is a moron. Why take the ball away from your best player and give arguably the best RB in the nation the chance to run it out.
Sadly this is how you get shit fixed
don't you know? the world is america only [NAME] Bless.
General malaise is a favourite. I get a lot of general malaise.
He mustn't know about Mr. [NAME] and the cause of his untimely death.
It usually comes out after people catch me dissociating.

How about breaking into tears whenever one of your friends tells you they trust you because you never understood what trust meant
No stop. One Red and yellow team had to be sacrificed for the fortunes of the other. I’m sorry

I’d be very concerned if the posts on this sub were coming from 7 year olds.
Holy shit I didn’t realize he didn’t fumble all season that’s wild
is it big market privilege? Cause the braves got fucked for similar crimes.
I have listened to him and that's how I know he's a terrible person and his goal is to turn impressionable people into terrible people like himself.
He played in the [NAME] and [NAME] era so it’s hard to get the spotlight for those years.
Wasn't hurtful at all. It felt comforting to me reading it. We're all good.
"Nope, no deal far more likely to starve the country than U-boat blockade."
[NAME] made me like a sleep walker.. I did things I didn't remember doing. Scary.
I dislike the shade he’s been throwing to our franchise and his inability to take responsibility for the reasons why he was traded

"Not only do they make me cringe, I become angry because usually or is my nmother and her flying monkey daughter posting them. Just horrible."
My wife is out for shabbos and I'm so lonely without her :(
This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.
WOW THATS SO INTERESTING It happens to me so often that when I hear a new word I anticipate it but it all makes sense now
"Yeah I'm actually pretty surprised that's not a thing yet, there's gotta be a lot of people working on it. "
"Stop calling them immigrants, that’s a lie. The term is “illegal aliens”."
"Yeah but that post is a day old so OP won't have any chance of getting karma off it, cmmon now"
No. It doesn't. And a moron on Reddit has no authority to say that it does.
Not liking [NAME] is not statism. Removed.
It's this kind of fear that made me make this
Holy shit I was so anxious reading this. I’m so sorry
"Don't be so hard on yourself. Often, things need time. Don't beat yourself up over it. "

In my few years playing I never knew this ... I feel so lost now
Oh come on! Stop posting this stuff. FFS will you think of my blood pressure!? You’re killing me (figuratively speaking).
He was shrieking at everything up until then. Like I said I was worried in the beginning but sometimes it works out.
Surprised [NAME] didn't add his hatred of interracial couples in the movie.
That was worse than a movie jump scare. I don't know why but giant squid feel more fearsome than sharks.
This is gatekeeping at it's worst People can be heartless Idiots it's amazing

"Dude, the elderly are some that are the most at risk of dying from the flu."

"Yeah, he knows about my mental health and how bad it cam get, we've tried all the things that have worked in the past "
I'm gonna say that I hate Randazzo's because of their terrible icing. Haydel's is decent and ships.
I'll take the downvotes and agree with you. Some of the ugliest looking things I've ever seen. Absolutely disgusting aesthetic.

Well obviously not. Some people have higher tolerances than others. That’s a fact. I don’t know what else to tell you.
It worries me that there are people that miss the meaning of a subject by so much. Your critical thinking skills sadden me.

No. Being a private investigator isn't illegal.
"I love reading positive stories!! Happy for you, OP!"

I can't believe offense blew such - oh nevermind.
"Man, dropping is rather dreadful but nothing’s more dreadful when you can reach into your pockets expecting it to be there and it isn’t "
"thank you, i dont get whats so hard to come to such an easy solution honestly"

[NAME] is an arrogant schmuk but he’s good at what he does.
Given [NAME] was in charge of the transition I don't see how he kept his hands clean. I think if [NAME] goes down so does he.
So glad to hear they got banned. Can't believe adults can still behave like that.

"That’s about what ours is, but our rush hour traffic is horrible."

Afraid not. I was just given a different perspective.
"This is really disgusting, the 4x4 community is one of the nicest around, Shame that a few c*nts gotta do shit like this."

I feel terrible for their daughter. I wouldnt want to grow up in between the middle of that.
Damn that coyote was a fucking noob.

It's even worse when one considers that they are intent on moving to Europe and that by moving to a developed region their carbon footprint will increase significantly.
It just seems extremely insensitive to say that. That’s the real problem. It invalidates the other person’s suffering.

You are not yet worthy to possess this knowledge. Watch the film and you may be rewarded.

Lovely places to buy from but very hard to get a good price as a seller because of their high rents (and bargaining expertise!)
The sad part is that we are not trying to tank
"Right now I'm listening to Stand By Me, I'm liking it "
"I like Sao very much, bit not because of the game setting, for other reasons. The game itself sucks, tbh."
"That's fucking awesome! I had no idea they would straight up off a dude for trifling! Lmao Winning information forsure, cheers man."
"Take it easy, hater. He nailed it."
wow that's next level here. I am familiar with people dangerously going over 2+ lanes and the zebras but I have never seen that in DFW.
Why is it dumb? It's not like once people get married they believe in a society that looks down on premarital sex. Maybe you missed my point.
Shocked basement leaking got you freakin lady
I was jumping the same gun but decided to do some googling just in case. Glad I did :)

I'm surprised [NAME] let her post that.
"You all are looking at this guy reading this book, but ARE YOU SEEING HOW HAIRY THIS GUYS ARM IS?!?"
they already ruined their own lives by having an affair. the other spouse knowing is just a consequence of their selfish actions.

You're an idiot and no one believes you and your telegram jerk-off buddies.
"Its very obvious to me he is still in love with her. He is definitely not in love with [NAME], the marriage will be a disaster."
[NAME] milquetoast reformism is still too radical for Wall Street.

Sorry was talking about OP being in Alabama.
when my egg cracked I went through like every teen girl phase in the space of 2 months lol
As it should be. No way I'd want my kid crossing 5 lanes of traffic to get to the bus everyday.
Still depressed but I didn't run away so it cool
Wow I typed that out before my eyes were awake 👀
"Oh my gosh, my Dodger blue heart goes out to yours and your family. I am so sorry."
Very surprised he didn't frog leap at the guy the close the distance

I love how all these suspects greet [NAME] like an old friend.

"No mercy, if there is any man left inside you than walk out now."
That is so sad. So your sisters got to ruin their bodies and forego a career? Yikes.
No because to them this disabled boy is faceless. It’s easier to digest our hate and vitriol without thinking about it.
"[NAME] is so rational, I’d just cry really hard if my parents spent all my college money 💰 "
Southern Mexico tends to always get fucked in the ass as well
I really hope no one actually thought [NAME] would be our coach for next season.
Not tryna plug or anything but i use InShot to crop my videos and it works fine It just makes me hurt inside seeing a screen record not cropped
Seriously? I couldn't even remember the dude's name until about halfway through the season honestly.
"It was a nice one too! GO AHEAD [NAME], SLAP THAT HAM!"
That was honestly my first thought I’m so glad someone else went there too

No usable cure was found for TB until 1945.

"Hi! :) Because I am broke, I guess."
You have no perspective. Go outside and get some friends.
"I also posted about this a few days ago. Maybe they have different designers but none of them has follow-up or approval from a single person, unfortunate"
Damn furries. We don't have animal ears!
Its definitely [NAME] fault for leaning into it though. Nobody’s pressuring her to have “Activist” in her Twitter bio.
"He is looking for the one that is leaking information, he doesn't want to throw anyone under the bus on purpose"
"I haven’t been keeping up with MHA, but this seems like a real bad idea"

I don't think either of them took that bump outside any worse than the other. That was jarring.
Yeah well first god says it’s an abomination. Also if people find out everyone will hate me and my parents will be extremely angry
I love how the dog is just happy the cat is giving him attention.
The fact that such awful designs exist almost makes me want to stop wearing leggings. *Almost.*
"Oh, so it isn't a term made up by antivaxers designed to be intentionally vague? I thought you said it was."
"Disturbing =/= awful. Its incredibly well done by a professional. I feel like this sub is more for unintentional awfulness, not purposeful shock value/ theatrical makeup."
Yes!!! You cannot expect her to be a good mother at 15.
"Woah, woah, woah. You're trying to tell me that elites have a stranglehold in a country with an *actual* aristocracy?! "
What's that like? Like what's the thought process? I dunno. I know what's a weird question..i just can't imagine
"Wow, I wonder who's going on about Tahiti in the background."
Man i was so sad when i found out vodka had calories
"I honestly thought that they could have chosen ""bigger"" words than those, [NAME] clearly knew what they meant!"
People hate their everyday lives already. Let him do his 2-3 years and see for himself why it sucks.
Why would you say that... Oh my [NAME] those tags!
I wanted to bring to others' awareness here to the site and its absurd name. I've removed the link now above.

Oh wow I didn't know this policy was in place in the 70s!
"Regardless, fight 'em every inch of the way like it's the last hill to die on. Complacency is complicity. "
This bit was more fun than it should have been.
I don’t care about the first seed until a week or so before the all star cut off?
Everyone hates these posts but when we do post them it’s because we too are also proud of the work we do. Congrats!

"Right there with you! Unladylike was so depressing, I couldn't keep listening to it."
Isn't it awesome. And then they get praised for their problem solving skills and dedication.
"Correct! Unfortunately, we're looking for a bit more computing experience than knowing what site you're on. Thanks for your interest though."
I wish I could forget. Stop reminding me :(
I appreciate you taking the time to at least justify your reasoning but I still very much disagree.
It's an absurdly racist phrase that these anti-racist activists are very comfortable using for some reason.
"I go to a neighborhood mexican restaurant monthly for the past 2.5 years, but nobody knows my name ☹"
"I will definitely check that artist out, if there is something that can lift me up a little bit, it's new music. "
"Thanks! Tbh I just set the limit from true to false, didn't want to mess anything up by changing it. What number what you recommend?"
I hate to break it to you but [NAME] ARENT signing here
"Wow, that sounds like it could be great."
Op forgot to mention his son has a rare scrotum disorder where the balls and shaft are reversed. Poor guy :(
Was just wondering about the mobile thing. I only use mobile and I've never noticed anything odd. It's not something people would care about anyhow.
> lots of ppl dont enjoy pvp I feel like these people are playing the wrong game genres lol.
> The cold hard truth is that they are the source of most of the antisemitism in Europe. Citation needed.
The comment was so terrible. I can’t believe it made the final cut.
"I love Subnautica. It's so, so terrifying but also beautiful and cool and I can wimp out and put it down any time. "
I really love how this team responds to injuries
Have I been eating avacodos wrong this entire time! Oh no!
Reminds me of that Black Mirror episode where the lady is brainwashed after committing a crime and forced to repeat the same government-made story with mind controlling phones forever
I wasn't digging it and then [NAME] did her spiritual spacewalk. I almost walked out.
> This isn't where I parked my car Seriously I can't find my car.
Not a single one of these allegations are of Russian collusion. It's more perjury trap nonsense.
Walking into Chick Fil A feels like walking into a church. No thanks. I will forever see them as a bigoted organization.
"I don't know you or your story, but I fucking love your syntax, word choice, etc 10/10 would trip with"
"Just because you would laugh, doesn't mean that the guy in the video would."
They have great chemistry and it’s a cool dynamic but it can’t take over the entire show
Newcomers have never heard of the flippening ever since :( that’s sad
"I'd take Florida winning it all this year, just so it's not Bama/Clemson 5"
"I dont think a murder log that survived what killed off trex counts as cute, even if its only 2 or 3m long. "
That's what this seems to be saying unless something was lost in translation
"I mean I still attend regular school, this is just a Saturday school. I'm just frustrated that I have to waste Saturday on this"
I would have thought this sub would be encouraging of religions and religious followers shifting their views into the 21st century.
"They also almost always miss, leading to that awful thin sheet of bagel that ends up as ash in the oven. "
"I swear, this is the most brutal one of this year yet. "
"I don't need any [NAME]. But if At the Gates actually I made a game, I'd be interested."
"I find it sadly ironic that a man's job is to protect his family, yet if he's alone with his children they question their safety."
If hes married and a decade down the road and tells her im sure itll be nothing more than a great laugh lol
It is pretty disappointing when you can't pet a service dog that's cute but the rule has to be followed.

"Really!? I thought it had, or at least it should. Guess I'm better off leaving too"
This post fucking sucks because it doesn't cater to my beliefs.
Your welcome. A simple “thank you” would’ve sufficed. Didn’t need the long-winded response. r/ChoosingBeggars
I so badly wish we could all gain this mindset and keep it. How easy would life be.
Get the hell out of here with that fiscal sensibility and care for other human beings!
"Also, on my phone this didn't show up as a ""cross post"". Sorry!"
I stopped reading @ “this one weird trick.”
That... sounds like gibberish. I expose myself to it in that it's my life. The rest of that sentence makes very little sense.
That's probably caused my the extreme density of infrastructure.
That’d be lovely. Although now I have to root for AD to the Lakers which makes my chest hurt
the negative connotation of eugenics is allowing dysgenics which is a far worse fate for humanity

You're not my real mom. I don't have to listen to you. Just because my dad loves you doesn't mean that I have to!
"Surprisingly, not a lot of people know though."
The real joke is always in the comments.
I don't think that makes for a fair deal. That $100 is far more valuable. It's more of a disposable income thing for me.
They killed [NAME] for being a [NAME] right after this. [NAME] was a notorious anti-Semite.
Oh noooo. I once accidentally rubbed my eye after handling habaneros. It's the worst.
It's weird that actual socialists will say that politics has moved far to the right.
Oh haha I’m from liberal MA and started having sex younger. I come from a sex positive environment.
You must have missed most of the thread then. :p

But I feel like such a tool!

A the_donald poster trying to pass as a human being has to be one of the saddest things I've ever seen.
"The truly great thing about this is how he looks down, disgusted, as if the comment were down there 😂"
My son told me he hates me
He really would be. It's not even an abortion anymore!;It's just post-birth killing!
Guilty :( I was ready to cry and everything >:(
That's just... Wow. I would've called CPS on her.
Omg... Yeah leave him sooner than later... Abusive men can kill women in the long future.
A lot of virgins would reject the label.
So the article is pretty much nonsense.
I'm so broke that I'd take if you're still looking. I'm a guy though.
I don’t have to stop speaking fact simply because it’s uncomfortable for you to hear.
[NAME] is a traitor to this country.
i am not a lesbonim so no (that's another friends reference btw)
it made me cry too when [NAME] return to her older self😢
"I was always in awe of just how stunning she was. She doesn't photograph well though, it's a shame. "
Wow... drug smugglers will always find a way I guess. I bet that took a ton of work

My only issue with private schooling is it discourages those with children in private schools from wanting money to go towards public education.
What is normal? It should be tho....
It's a shame you're sticking up for a dictator who orders the beating and shooting of protesters in the street.
Lol. Your dad made me laugh. Tell him thanks.
He is like a bad cartoon that’s hard to turn off.
"This is still an inappropriate photo, no matter what type of dog it is"

"As a teacher with a bunch of sick students, this scares the hell out of me."
"I'd say no, mostly because you don't plan to stay long-term."
Drunk and crying in bed with my pets. :|
Yea I guess I did. I forget how popular the bulls brand is overall. I just hate when people call others dumb because they talk/tweet in slang.
"[NAME] why do they keep adding words to facist. Neofascist, cryptofascist, snowfascist. It's so dumb."
"Watched it last night and as someone not generally into supernatural horror/thriller type stuff, I thought it was pretty damn enjoyable. "

I had a guy who just kept jumping off the bridge in Eichenwald to his death over and over.. in a placement match.. WHY!

That explains an awful lot about ICP.

Thank you for the thorough reply! I definitely can’t say I’m not lucky for a long time after this.
Yes. I often dream of death or further isolation

I was expecting this to go MUCH worse than it did and I’m so glad my imagination wasn’t right.
Wow you just disregarded his entire comment.
I don’t think that tells us any moralising lesson on the practice of incest.
"I'm happy however those two don't get a ring. Would be overjoyed if it was at the hands of [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]."
I hate his hoist a shit shot and throw your legs forward so you can draw a foul on the defender for crowding your landing space.
I have the same issue with a new co-worker and it drives me insane.
"Given it looks like a cotton field, it feels a bit more sinister than that. "
Interesting to point out cognitive dissonance while also showing that you possess it when it comes to the president!
"This is an incredible insight I've never thought of before. loyalty vs disloyalty, compared to care vs harm, I mean."
What a nasty goal! Gives you chills!
I didn’t like that blue & yellow until you said [NAME].
No you are providing more than enough evidence. Post histories do exist. Now fuck off.

We gotta throw the whole world away

9Gag was my jam back in high school! Pleasure to meet an alumni
You can always tell from the vote counts lol. They're way too blatant
You better have done 3oh!3 proud and twisted
He most likely saw you and just didn’t care. Sadly.
It's not G A M E R time unless we get to berate women and minorities.
">Also, you realize that both parties largely dabble in identity politics. Oh absolutely! It's a major reason I hate [NAME]. "
If you're going out with a big group then this doesn't seem so bad. Everyone gets something to eat and it's fun.
I don't think either of them took that bump outside any worse than the other. That was jarring.
Hey! I play the lottery every week-this will eventually affect me...
Girl I got you. guys haven’t experienced culture where basically every girl calls herself fat or tries to restrict their eating because they have insecurity or dysmorphia
I've also heard that intriguing but also kinda scary
> But you will probably find you are noticeably worse looking at 40 than you are at 27. Well that's disappointing.
Same! I don’t know how our elementary level colleagues do it. When I subbed in elementary a few times it was awful.
I don’t care about this mission Texas stuff

I fell like you're being willfully ignorant of reality.
"You can’t change my mind about the officiating, I know what I’ve seen"
I'm with you - I feel no connection....
Yeah people used it as precedence. That’s very sad. What’s your point? What abhorrent treatment?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 you got the wrong [NAME] —
"I mean, it certainly is weird but don't kinkshame"
> and no one but angry community fanboys have pushed back against his statements.
Omg yes feels like being new born.
Maybe we'll just stop moderating for a while to celebrate TWOW.
oliver and black canary is evergreen.. [NAME] is the most annoying character since season 3.. why would CW come up with that
IANL I have never thought twice about doing a little extra shoveling to help a neighbor. Can't imagine that it could be illegal.
With the way [NAME] carried himself in Hard Knocks I wouldn’t be surprised if he flew off the handle during his firing.
I just use undercrackers or crackers. Knickers/panties sounds weird when I say it
"There's no doubt that [NAME] is entitled, but I don't think she's evil like [NAME]! "
Surprised he didn’t get hit with a random drug test

Was against Cal but yeah [NAME] had a cannon of a leg but was very inaccurate Also had terrible hair
"I love how nobody posting here to decry the buzzfeed article is using their actual accounts, they’re all throwaways. Cowards. Just like your felonious President."
So how depressing is it that I know that's not true? You still gotta pay for a cold delivery.
That's such a selfish mentality to have.
"A girl bashed my then girlfriends head in with a cane, she didn't even get jail time. "

"Yeah right, like other government look to [NAME] to learn something our politics is hot mess won't happen, will stay a dream I guess"
"Oh look, someone who doesn't understand how living languages work."
You know I’m sad the [NAME] hype is over because I actually think he’s been really good for us overall. I still trust him.
I hope you survive this. Losing a friend is a heavy loss
I can’t believe sb found this even remotely funny.
"Wow, I might actually watch this weirdo movie this time. "
"yea he had 6 assists which created 13 points, if he had 13 points and no assists people would be calling it a great game for him"
I encountered a shark whilst hiking last year. He wasn’t the least bit interested.
I am really disappointed in everyone today. Not a single murmur was mentioned. People only murmur in [NAME] world.
The UN said the election was a sham. The man is causing death destruction and starvation. Your morals are completely and utterly fucked.

I think [NAME] does a great job! Can't believe she's 56...she looks amazing!
Female INTP and i concur! Especially the kids bit! And the Adorkable!
[NAME] wasnt elite for anywhere near 15 years. Surprises me how many people suggest this.
Incels can't even get a pleb thing called sex. Sex is for [NAME] apparently.
just speculation at this point but it's not looking good
I... can’t tell if sarcasm; because literally all of those positions involve cynicism.
You badly need to do more research than just a few good operations. There are a lot of terrible ones.

Noooo I missed the blood moon again. Someone post a pic
"I love them, it's so fun to jump around everywhere"
"oh, what an unlucky woman, that mother of his..."
I don't think that's true. Every major story I remember from the [NAME] investigation has been from court documents.
I remember running into teachers at the grocery store or whatever when I was a little kid and having that same feeling!
I told you I'm not in the mood for a snog tonight!
"one dude puked on my patio, he fell out at 2am! weak!"
"Trolling cat lovers used to be funny, 24 years ago."
It's irrelevant though. it doesn't need to be specified in the title of a post.
Actually whoosh doesn't apply here because the criteria for whooshing is different.
"Hmmm, I knew of the change but is ops post karma increasing? It doesn't look like it on their profile"
Don't make me talk about [NAME]... ...
I don’t know why but watching this makes me super happy!
Yeah - thanks - I vaguely remember this. I wonder what her net worth was year by year? Too lazy to investigate.
I heard [NAME] was an absolute monster too... Jk folks
"Congrats! Enjoy a free slice, I think you know what to do with this 🍕"
"This show has completely gone downhill, can’t believe I waited a month to be disappointed smh"

Sometimes I just go on the YouTube video for any song older than like 20 years and these comments never disappoint
I don't remember this song at all I had it on psp back then.
I don't think we can threaten them with something that's likely to be illegal to convince them.
I feel like its got to do with the bad desync in the game right now.

He’s 30 freaking years old and is scared of managing a bank account. *eyeroll*

I can’t call anyone Daddy. Not even my Dad. It just feels weird and creepy and I’m not 4.
Isn't the minimum 3 majors or something? I don't think he made the cut but I'd be happy to be proven wrong
Cant wait til [NAME] passes him. [NAME] is an ungrateful mofo. Anyone that praises their own work ethic and hard work needs slapped silly.
"I might be alone here, but it was probably Blame Game. I don't think I heard a rap song with that much emotional intensity before."

Oh shit. Is back?! Time to import
"I got angry briefly, made a post and got over it quick. Thanks for the diagnosis Doctor. 😆"
So we should put all children in the school at risk?
"True, but it is deceptive when dealing with c diff, it may give them a false sense of security."
It's not even that... just string in the water.
I’m excited AF. First holiday in four years. Totally cannot afford it but that’s future [NAME] problem.
No it's laziness. People don't clean because there isn't an immediate consequence and the reward for cleaning isn't large enough.
Frame data won't save you from 50/50s that can be initiated off of lights in VT1. He's probably the most explosive character in the game.

BPA not fit especially when we dont have a good team
i can't believe i havent seen this before. well i was going to watch nosferatu tonight but change of plan
Glad we got that criminal off the streets! No-good [NAME]. Tsk tsk
I did that in origins but now that theres mercenaries and its sooo annoying to deal with them so i stay as quiet as i can until im caught.
[NAME] is that guy downvoting everyone who doesn't think we should draft him.
Sorry to hear that was all it got :/
"Oh man, I didn't expect that: It kept rolling on his face!"
This converstaion reminds me of this old [NAME] cartoon. Apparently some people were upset by it.
Wait wait wait... did [NAME] go 61-27??
as much as I could tolerate - sadly I gave you a view.
"Ooh, and they make the joke be able to be known by everyone so viewer thinks they are special"
"I like the energy [NAME], [NAME], DFS put out."
Given I had zero interaction I couldn't even be mad. I think I chuckled
I can just do it with my eyes open. Is that weird? It kind of hurts.
You're not my STBXH hehe. He doesn't type like you.
They'd probably just use it to buy up armies and navies for tyrants who oppress and reign with blood and horror or some shit.
He said some facts and you accused him for being 50c. From his tone you can't even tell he's a supporter of CPC.

"No, he wasn't the entire problem, but his performance can't be excused by coaching alone. He's just not very good."
I would stay away from [NAME]. Apparently his injury got infected and will require more surgery/surgeries
What the fuck Edit: YOOOO I SWEAR MY DOOKU JUST SAID ONE OF HIS EMOTES IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
IIRC those who made those statements while it occurred were lambasted as conspiracy theorists by the conforming majority. Life is full of surprise.

Vote every one of them out that was quoted as being upset about the wire and not the corruption.
"That was a hell of a tip, that happens"
I think it's weird that he didn't just wake you up and weirder that he didn't tell you until you noticed it was missing.
That would be terrible. I liked the way private Practice ended (more or less) so hopefully [NAME] doesn’t go for something cliche.
"For serial rapists, its not about the physical pleasure. Its all head games. Damn freaks"
I'm not different than [NAME] secret refusing to sell male clothing.
"Agree 100% I guess I'm just happy to see anyone, even total scumbags, willing to criticize dear leader. "
I’m hoping! She wasn’t bad at all in this episode!
"come on, Redwings won, Knights need to win. give me another 2-fer, baby!"
We used to do a lot of terrible shit in the past that’s not a good argument
Definitely fake. Looks like bad CGI in a movie.
r/rareinsults also i’m surprised this guy isn’t fussing over the “it’s” instead of “its”
Did anyone else notice [NAME]' face twitching a little?
Thanks. I’m not ok with the behavior I’m.just having a difficult time accepting what I must do.
Good to hear that! I’ve seen many ppl trashing [NAME] customer service so I was kinda worried

I always feel so bad for [NAME] when I watch this scene.
You sure its not just the host quitting which disconnects everybody? Happens all the time and its incredibly frustrating.
PD would probably get us [NAME] so we would all get pump faked until you realize he got the wrong one. Exhibit A [NAME] -_-
"i disagree with that, you cant say everyone in the country does that, you dont know every [NAME] and their entire life stories stories"
This man makes aggressive grunts while breathing
"Ironic, since [NAME] is literally doing that, but with migrant children"
The last two years have made me see why [NAME] do what they do.
"Technically, that time passed a very long time ago. She might not have much of an option anymore. "
malicious intentions? what are you talking about?
Ahahaha I’m enjoying your troll. Seriously remember commenting on it like a year ago. Hilarious people are still trying to correct you.
Wonder which one belongs to [NAME] and what would be his final carbon footprint tally for this trip alone.
Problem is that most of the female posters here either do it for attention or almost immediately ghost because they come to their senses.
She got the death penalty...? fck me.

"22 hours and emailed support an hour ago, no answer yet. Will update here on progress."
This one is hitting people that knew him hard. He was such a happy guy all the time. Hopefully they catch the bastard soon.
You can't compare general economic losses to tax funded expenditures. It would only be fair if we lost 5 billion in tax revenue.
[NAME] earned it I think. He was godlike at world's. But [NAME] is the absolute worst S+ on this list.
I am so sorry for your loss. I lost my Brother a few years back. My thoughts and heart is with you.
It's amazing the people here supporting the [RELIGION] church and the child molesters over duterte... I wonder why.
It’s ironically calling British people ugly as a meme i guess

It's the universe trying to kill us with radiation :D
I feel so bad anytime I see anyone fall on their face... I just want to make sure they are ok.

Ask the Magic 8 Ball again later. We can't predict your future.
But beat the warriors Celtics and rockets. Pistons love messing with our emotions

Whining on reddit about whining in game.
"I knew nothing about the cult, and it is one of my 2 or 3 favorite Netflix originals. "
I think I'm kinda the same way like I change up so much everything I say feels like a lie... See just did it again. Fuck.
Being a [NAME] is no different from being a [NAME]. Both have caused genocides. I hate how our society only focuses on one though!
It still amazes how many people on this show and family by the ton can do perfect splits lol
Way braver than me. Hope you have a great night. Cheers!
I do this with lemons in my water at restaurants and it freaks people out a little sometimes. Lemons are just yummy.
"To be fair, the world (especially politics) has been kind of a shit show since 2016"

She shouldn’t have to fight a male.
In the prequels the son couldn't save the mother. Maybe things will be different this time...

Disgusting making [NAME] talk to this fat moron
It's the number one reason I refuse to exercise.
because people are idiots and don't like being wrong
She just missed her shot at a champagne douche.
I feel like the last two seasons made me detach from the show.
The only one to really be sad about losing is [NAME] tbh
Sometimes this is the hardest thing to deal with. I also am still clinging to a crush with a close friend. Just be honest.
"Ha, who cares about them supporters...the most important thing for society is that justice is served and the man jailed! Scream all you want. "
He most likely saw you and just didn’t care. Sadly.

"Well I am a lady, so that would probably just freak them out. Oh, Reddit. Everyone is a man haha. "

Nah. It's their job. Just tip well
My friends that were badly injured from the first fight. Read my backstory comment.

"Indeed! Oh [NAME], you are in for a horrible life..."
Me too lmaoooooooooooooooooooo haha damn that’s depressing
I’m disappointed that no one has suggested taking her up Oxo Tower yet.
They are unable to think out of the box
I would love to get microblading but its so iffy about if it’ll be good or not. I’ve seen a lot of terrible turn outs
I agree with that sentiment. But Doordash is not a job worth doing. I worked for less than minimum wage all summer.
I still maintain the packers were a worse team this year.
So he “wants to be in Denver”. Hooray. Can we hire the best guy instead?
"I can’t imagine choosing McD’s over Banh Mi, that’s just a complete lack of respect for your taste buds."
Those mindsets are extremely dangerous to our democracy.

It's bad when that sounds tasty to me
"I was booing loud, so were a lotta others. That muthafuckah"
You sure its not just the host quitting which disconnects everybody? Happens all the time and its incredibly frustrating.

Sorry for your loss yesterday. Your team is poised to do even better in the years to come and hopefully they will.

"[NAME] instead of [NAME] for me, but glad to see [NAME] is doing well."
Me as [NAME] with shatter ready when I see [NAME] & [NAME] alone in the back line:
I was just in shock when she answered the door for devoin.
"Great for him professionally, but the employees he takes the credit from? Not so much."
Plus [NAME] has won before. [NAME] is a perennial loser. All he has ever done is played on teams that were the worst in the NHL.
If hes there in the third he might be worth the pick. His tape looks atrocious tho.
Omg what simple brilliance. The nbme is a waste of time!? Genius!
I just thought I would be remise if I did not engage with the subject.
"Have to admit, a completed quest log would've been nice."
Heyyy that's the chair i'm sitting in right now at my home office!
I love the way you phrased that. I do believe she is terribly afraid to look inward at herself.
"Even then, the commentor could have gotten the joke and was just being dead pan. "
What a pain. I don’t understand the tantrums whatsoever. Respectfully decline or express incompatibility and some of them just explode out of no where! Smh

It's weird knowing that the people in these pictures are actually real You kinda forget sometimes
"“Not a word you need to learn, honey” Cringiest part of the whole episode."
Every time you share this with someone you teach your body that you don't need to hide this.
I'm glad you have someone to help you out! Perhaps over time you'll find it easier.
"indeed, but im worried that this matchup will end up as the biggest bait since years and rookie will crush him badly"
Same thing happened (to a slightly lesser degree) with [NAME] last year and it made for a lot of heartbreak that some never quite got over.
Oh I hate him even more now.
Id be pretty weary if a girl wouldn't talk about previous relationships.
Wow i didn't really expect both the explosion and him to live
You get closure by blocking her on your phone and all social media. She dumped you. It's over.
"I skipped school, went directly to be an apprentice. No regrets."
This was the scene that hooked me on the show.
"Besides it being hard and fucking up your kettles, irons, hair and taps?"
This is the strangest rendition of our national anthem that I’ve ever heard.
I feel horrible for the government workers caught in the middle of this. I hope it ends soon.
"Do You Realize, by The Flaming Lips. But it's not really ruined because we ended/still are on good terms. It just kinda makes my heart feel heavy."
I wonder how many didn't get the joke
Fuuuuck. I feel this. In my core.

"what do you wanna bet [NAME] thought they meant ""his"" campus sexual assault info as opposed to everyones and just stalled to be safe?"
Zoos are the reason why many endangered species are no longer endangered. You oppose the existence of zoos. Therefore you would rather see those animals go extinct.
"No offense but you have no idea what you’re talking about. Maybe you like neurotic, needy men, but the general populace does not."
No it's not. It's two people legally allowed to kiss kissing. Whatever stigma you have is yours and not shared by everyone.

But if I had a right to it as a member of society then I have committed no wrong.
"So sounds like she was raped, and she seriously needs to press charges, this bartender needs to be raped in prison big time."
Game day activities would be my guess. Not positive though.
What? Who said I hated him? I dont give a damn about him either way.
[NAME] and [NAME] statues look so like their current ages when [NAME] looks significantly older :(
Hmm experiencing sex from each other’s point of view would be interesting 🤔
Here too. I just find weird colorful stuff and hope it doesn't clash too bad.
I drive for a living so I have a pretty high-end camera that captures license plates!
Is he and his wife still together? I'm late on these things. 😭
When everyone is lying who are you supposed to believe ?
I’m shocked at how big that defeat is.
Oh true I remember seeing it on Spotify’s charts for weeks. It’s terrible.
"But we not out performing like she is, we just need a less matte version to keep us through our daily struggle life. "
This made me sad. I hope you find happiness.

It's not unheard of but there are certainly candidates ([NAME]?) who aren't quite to her level on guns.
Was at the game yesterday and at the game now. It's a miserable gong show. Why do I keep doing this to myself?
Still depressed but I didn't run away so it cool
Why does he take offense to something that you did to YOUR body? It's YOUR body. I think it's blatant disrespect from his part.
Fuck you I was in the bed:/

"[NAME], aside from the goal was several magnitudes worse than [NAME]...."
I definitely wouldn’t do a role change at the tournament but definitely when they get home. I should’ve clarified that sry.
"I disagree with you, therefore you must be an idiot. K."
"I'm not fantasising, I'm watching it happen. Just like I watched [NAME] smooth, supple back."
Fuck knows. They’ve stated both on seperate occasions. The media is all over them.
There's a difference between use and ownership. They aren't equivalent.
Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.
"Oh wow, this is the first I've heard of her aligning with those people. "
"This can’t be the end of the back, garbage TV! I’ll miss you!"
And the problem is that they took doctors out of a&e and out patients and community services and gp's to pay for his monstrosity...
"one's a rapist, and the other's a stingy yank a bit of a difference in situations no matter how much we hate [NAME]"
[NAME] rolls with his kitties and is hard as fuck.

The sad truth is that all the feelings you get are real and genuine in that moment
"Wait, they banned his mother from travelling too? "
"yeah but like I’m highkey anxious about getting shocked and screw Apple for getting rid of the rainbow logo, it was so cool"
Cant you tell how sad she is from her face?
"I read that whole thing, so damn funny. But seriously, all those guys need to be sterilized."
">doesn't make a border wall ineffectual. As ineffectual as the TSA is, at least they can't be defeated by a simple ladder."
Well if he takes his daughter to a nightclub then that’s a bit inappropriate
"Most men who gtow have had relationships in the past that turned out to be disasterous, and now they're just salty about women."
Oh! Im also Chinese (Singaporean) and due to the laws here my boyfriend and i are looking to go elsewhere...
Rec and Red just need to die as teams. Fucking joke of a performance here considering how much funding they are both getting.
"Threaten to release....welp , nothing coming from this."
"There's part of me that hates this, And part of me that thinks it's good"
that day humanity received a grim reminder
That's what I'm afraid of but I don't have a lot of free time so it would never work.
Can confirm. I never dip pieces of fish into milk. Not makpid about cheese though.
Rheged sounds like a racist name for a [NAME]. Don't think it will catch on tbh

I think only bc skilled players play her. Tbh I am not one of them
I fucking love ten min power hour xD
That's probably the price a [NAME] pays to rent the Trump Hotel D.C. Ballroom for a cocktail party. Whoop de fucking doo.
Ew yes I’m glad you brought that up.
EWWW yes. This makes me shudder. All wet and gross.
I wish they didn’t hate [NAME] so much. Feels bad to play her.
There is no way around it :(
After reading a lot of replies you should bee ashamed of yourself. This thread is a hive of bad puns and references.
Does this attitude go for anything where you accidently end up killing someone via stupid behaviour?
I usually do. I didn’t stay up until midnight the preceding Sunday thusly I missed out on my block-hoarding opportunity.
That was my first live Lions game (British and flights to DTW are expensive) I've never gone through so emotions in such a short amount of time

This is why I have no sympathy for parents who can't make time for their kids because of their jobs.
"I mean, if I make it look like an accident, just think of all the ribs I can buy with the insurance money... "
May [NAME] bless your efforts. I wish I could be there. De verdad soy Panameňo.

Thank you. I’ve been feeling a bit better since they make people happier.

I remember that! She crashed and they asked her to leave lol. That was one of my fav moments.
A track would be much more suitable for this kind of recklessness! Keep this kind of dangerous driving off of public roads!

"Omg, there is a wallet made out of a dead squirrel on that sub! *SUBSCRIBED*"

Why is everyone smoking out of straws and shit?!
Wow. I could have gone my entire life without witnessing this limpdicked haemorrhoid rank the severity of sexual assault based on who the victim is.
I quit soda about a month ago and this makes me want to go buy an entire 2-liter just to comfort myself
Meh 2 years of bad teams under [NAME] coming off of 3 straight great years wasnt so bad. The 00's were far worse.

This is as subtle as the 2nd choice is the MP telling you to go and fuck yourself.
That’s really cool! How did you do this?
Very possible but there's absolutely zero indication were working on a deal to trade [NAME] currently. We're not just going to trade him away for peanuts.
They still make VCRs? This makes me happy and I’m not quite sure why.
"Wow amazing, anyone know where can I find more at higher resolution?"

The cheerfulness of the “hail satan” text overlay was unexpected.

If this is serious mate it’s not the kind of shit you should be posting on reddit
"Judging by my 10 month old, that is about 2.5 days worth of dirty diapers. "
"What a fucking moronic jackass. ""This is what happened with my piece of shit dad so you have to experience it too"""

Cut the guy off and gave him a yes-no question. Which he exasperatedly answered. This is not the way to listen.

"[NAME], she really is my least favorite queen I drag race history. Boring, try-hard, and busted makeup."
Guys. Our defense is bad outside of like two guys.
Happy to assist with the credit repairs. I've been in the industry for over 20 years. It takes time but it's fixable.
Wish they would of given air vehicles some love. A lot of ace pilots hated the game.
Im not 😀 Glad you realize your mistake and why I was confused 😉
I can't imagine it's going to be easy to come to the realization that your parents murdered your brother.
Maybe ask some neighbours if there have been any strange or noteworthy comings and goings during the day.
"The sad part is he actually looks pretty good with it, better than the design he has for most of the game."

Benzos do not help anxiety long term. they make it worse
I like how bro is just underlined for no reason
The only time this movie should encourage blindfolds is when watching it. Then hopefully you won’t witness the giant plot holes and terrible ending.
A video was just released showing this altercation. Within Syria is rarely wrong.
Thank you! I'm so glad you liked it! I did finally get a new belt lol

We can work on both. Ignore centrists who want to pretend that we have to choose.
That’s very creepy and weird. Hopefully this pup was not being carted around with ulterior motives.

"Translation: ""I have no argument so here's a rude comment""."
"Sorry, didn't know where else to put it"
"That will catch up to him eventually, but right now he is dangerous"
That's why it would be amazing if [NAME] or [NAME] pull a Helsinki 2.0 and release a bombshell right before the president's speech tonight.
Same. But the 21 point lead drew me in.......who knew you can lose by double digits leading by that much.
I don't generally find the CBO projections very accurate in retrospect. Some of their accounting practices and metrics seem error prone.
"You're just lonely, dude. Don't mix that feeling with love."
He's back! I missed him. He is the most entertaining thing on this sub.
"Colts fan here. [NAME] seems like a nice enough guy but, holy crap, terrible coach. Buyer beware."
In shock and was more concerned about my kid tbh. Now off course I wish I'd sued the arse off her for emotional distress.
"We had the chance, but never made the offer last year."
She must have a very boring life
"Oh weird, the money I make is taxed when I earn it and then it gets taxed when I spend it"

"While true, that's not what they're talking about here"
Oof. Didn't see what happened but cizikas like died on the ice there for a minute.
This happens all too much. The game cannot keep up with so many actions especially if ur ping is bad
"Bruh, fake music was the fucking best, wish we could go back."
It's even worse when one considers that they are intent on moving to Europe and that by moving to a developed region their carbon footprint will increase significantly.
That doesn’t seem like very responsible presentation of findings.
"holy shit that person is a fucking asshole, talk about a huge red flag for your stepbrother."

"Am I not supposed to have what I want, what I need"
"Hmm surprised that went on for as long as it did, at some point there must have been some redeeming qualities. "
You can't freely make a decision when your opinions are a shitty contract or life on the streets. That is not freedom.
"One time my 1 stopped right in 91st, I was able to get a good photo of the platform since they have some lights along it."
It's almost like people live in this bubble where there are only magatards and hillshills. No inbetween. Only hyperpolarization.
What really? I cant believe no one has ever said that before! You may have saved my life.
Never hurts to double check but it can doubly hurt to not check at all
There's doing stupid things when you're young. Then there's doing horribly stupid things when you're in your mid-30s and you're already active in Politics
Well ‘hanging with the bros’ is happening either way. It’s what I do in the morning.
You need to recheck your science. A simple Google search will yield research articles showing a biological and genetic basis for being LGBT. Happy reading!
im trying to but my depression gets the better of me i have my good days and bad days
This is so repulsive and disgusting. The government needs to do more to protect organising.
He didn't see him and afterwards tried to high five him but [NAME] was walking away
AQUARIA STANDING THERE SILENTLY IS SENDDDINGGG ME

[NAME] was just calling you out for being rude as fuck
"It was a few years ago now, I’m afraid I don’t have it or I would."
"Not the snowbank, though. That will end badly in spring."
That is what we love to hear. :) We hope you enjoy the game and that we see you again soon!
It's interesting that they don't know to take the handset off the hook before dialing.
"What an ugly shade [NAME] used to dye his hair. Well, I guess it matches the infamous shirt."
Well hopefully we’ll find out how hard her life was tonight ☺️
"You know all politicians do this/have done this or similar things to their own compensation, right? Hate the game, not the player"
People tremble in fear of the name Rupple Poopels 😂
I'm just glad I've never heard of this game before otherwise this news would be disappointing.
>he definitely doesn't value my pleasure this is very sad
Ugh this moment really had me crying lol just hearing him remember all the good I was like WHY
In many states the law prosecutes the server just as harsh as the lawbreakers when it comes to alcohol. Dram shop law
All jokes aside my birthday is January 2nd as well if yours really is
I want him to change and realize he messed up and he needs to do better

She talks about him getting some manners... She's the only without manners... and she should've gotten kicked off...
Gungrabbers? You act like they're busting in your door and taking your guns. No one is forcing you to do this.
[NAME] has been doing everything great except for shooting. It will start falling eventually

I'm sad for the bot. They only want a purpose
I lowkey hope I'd find this in the comments somewhere Was not disappointed
She can also say she's committed to the public system while still wanting two tier. So what she said there truly means nothing.
I love that OP “loved” his insult. It’s like the ultimate slap in the face to this CB.
You completely missed the point of the meme...
Still concluding I’m disingenuous despite getting your facts wrong. Big ego you’ve got.
I agree about that hill and visibility. Why they put that Starbucks in a poorly accessed place is beyond me.
Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants
I feel like its got to do with the bad desync in the game right now.
The real tips are always in the comments :D
I thought you only get to be a wizard after you're 30yo and still virgin

No...how dare you bring factual evidence into this conversation! /s
Imagine thinking that a rapist isn't deserving of prison. He's not even sorry.
I am so sorry those kind of people make me sick
No it isn't. Not much than your OP. You just have nothing outside of your feelings.
For both of you together? The fuck company are you using.
I just came off of watching all of his movies. Dear [NAME]. I love and hate them at the same time.
a weird way to spell Boys Don’t Turbo Grafx 16
"Yeah I think it's up near beaches or something, I don't really go up that area "
They laughed in our faces for a decade. Not to mention they were actually cheating (bountygate).
Is that seriously the story? I haven’t googled it. I just thought it was cool as a WW2 buff
My heavens people are getting upset about this.
I love how he looks around for a flag and doesn’t celebrate at first
u the type of guy to still defend [NAME] even after the flashbacks arent ya
"Cheers, I enjoyed your announcers. Sucks we don't get to play again until next year"
I can't help it when everyone just loves us ¯_(ツ)_/¯
Deep blue eyes look weird to me. The rest seems pretty good.
I moved to Canada in 2001 from the middle east. I'm still not used to it. I hate cold.

I fucking love New Years day with the Hawks playing in the Winter Classic
The fake news media and it's supporters are the enemy of the people.
Shame our government can't progress as fast as the infrastructure.
We thought we had seen the lowest of the low in 2016. Wait for 2020 it's going to be ugly.
You've violated rule 4. Please adhere to the rules of engagement.
You laugh at them. Openly. For being childish and naive. If they don’t react to facts maybe they’ll react to wounded pride.
Instagram is the only one to blame for all this evil
My [NAME] accuses me of cheating all the time too when I’ve been nothing but loyal. Makes me wonder if she was cheating on me too...
You’re argument is so bad you’re now asking people to deny common sense because you can’t prove your point LOL super pathetic
I'm glad I'm not the only one that allocates points for road kills.
I wish the theme was still larger than life but their outfit prompt was fetish/bdsm wear and that they all posed next to giant sex toys
It doesn't. It really doesn't. I just had a 2nd one a few weeks ago.

You may have been watching a tad too hard bro lol No judgment here
No kidding. Pretty sure my husband enjoys it as much as I do.

I was freaking out watching this. WTF are the parents!?
I can hardly hear you over those goal posts moving! Ahhhh the facts! They hurt! They hurt so bad mama!

Yeah but people are dumb and mesh everything together because thinking about specific situations is clearly too hard
You just brushed off the entirety of his video and reverted back to the original argument.

The first comment wasn't but when you not wanted you should just fuck off
I don't know why this image bothers me so much
I'm not a victim at all. You're just a desperate loser who spends money on a guy he could watch for free.

Happened to me today...ended my shift early.
Putting any human on the same level as [NAME] is sacrilegious and you should be ashamed for spreading such blasphemy.
I would be surprised if she's doesn't have at least 1 kid
You should check out my comment at the bottom of this thread of why I somewhat support antifa. This comic is obviously fearmongering conservatives.
Wow that feels like discrimination against the poor [NAME] kind.
"You think that hearing deathcries is **funny** ? Personally, hearing cries of pain and dispair don't cause me enjoyment, but I guess I'm a weirdo."
You have to assert dominance or they'll never learn.

There is nothing that back ups his claims. To me his views sounds more like wishful thinking.
Wow good on you! I hope to have similar progress this year. How’d you do it?
True but also it's not a dilemma ; if they try something like Tiananmen they will likely die. So not very tempting to try to change things.
He is going to cheat or leave...maybe both
Idk how tf he was able to play on pot and booze that sounds hard af to do
"A supposedly professional article banging on about gammons and insulting people's appearance. Not an impressive display of journalism, just a pathetic blog designed to preach to the choir."

I see a 14 day old reddit account angry at liberals.
She looks like an early game killer.
He has a humiliation kink. He's clearly not expressing it in a healthy way and should probably see a therapist and/or a professional [NAME].
Imagine being as fragile as that woman.
"Yup. What is interesting is that Newton's third law is not applicable to SJWs... they arose out of a self-hating, anti-free speech vacuum."
"I don't believe it is. like other posters have said, you can do better. I know it's hard but you are strong. "
Mine once went 6 hours overdue. It was horrible. Big hugs to you. Drink all the wine you can find!

"This better be a troll because if not, you are the most obnoxious, self centered, asinine person on this face of this planet."
I have my reasons for wanting to quit
Not to mention that the full video is part of the kids PR campaign according to [NAME] idiot
I bet if anyone else had his condition without being a Veteran would have served some sort of punishment.
"Ugh I never thought I'd be someone that gets jealous about shoes, which ones did you get?"
Dude was using his power and leadership to exploit women. This is gross.

ESPN and sports is not a good combination.
Incorrect. I'll go with what [NAME] tells me thanks.
This is the most early 2000s thing ever. I love it.

Not worth it. My family is the same way. I am scapegoat. I cut them all off and I have never been happier or more at peace
"Wow, that crazy. Hope this doesn't happen again with you. Stay safe!"
They laughed in our faces for a decade. Not to mention they were actually cheating (bountygate).
Tbf I don't think you can get much snakier than wishing for someone's pet to die

"I'm all for not getting too crazy because we've had a rough stretch, but [NAME] scoring twice hurt. A lot."
"Ah man, so many memories of those skits"
"And in some US states, still that range just sets off weird vibes."
If the issue is Abortion yes. My generation was genocided.

"I would hope that Cartoon Network would have nothing to do with it. Would hate to see them ""Teen Titan"" ASOIAF. "
Yeah because streaming services don’t pay their artists well enough
At no point in the game has that been true
That's the reason I am terrified to wear contacts on duty. I'm afraid it'll get stuck between my contacts and eyes and destroy my pupils.
"Rule of cool: horses are sweet, and fun, and lancing someone is an awesome animation."
That is even worse. No tax from them and we provide them with services.

Last 30 seconds where [NAME] and [NAME] were silent to listen to the crowd gave me chills. Such a fun game and team! Aho is my dad
"So unsurprised by this, one of the most hated people in the music world. "
"Please keep going, this is just making you look worse"
That was the first thing we tried and we could not get it to work.

We are up 2-0 and this game is pissing me off so much.
Theres nothing more despicable in this world than a carelessly brewed mug of chai brother. You gotta get with the program.

And it needs to keep pushing harder and harder to the left in order to wash away all the crap that's been enacted since [NAME] got into office.
My love for [NAME] has nothing to do with his Blackpool performance
Downvoted despite posting facts; even the self-proclaimed moderate subs can’t help but be partisan.
"Thanks for saying that, but yeah: you really need to do something about your boy there. He’s not right."
This must have been the fastest reply I've ever gotten omg

Everyone’s freaking out about our OC. Our need for O-line is more substantial imo
"Huh, and all these years I’d been *assured* “nobody” was coming to take my guns. Its like they been lying the entire time."
"Happy birthday, [NAME]! Hope you have a wonderful day!"
Its hard to explain i feel everything is distant.

Maybe it is offended which is why he commented in the first place

Sure it's okay. Very sorry for your loss. Your dad's posts kept me coming back here when I was just a lurker. Much appreciation.
"Can I just say that the Elizabeth Line is still a bloody stupid name, and no I don't think I'll just get used to it."
I saw this on here less than 2 days ago. You could at least repost old content that we haven't seen in a while.
"Home field advantage is barely a thing lmao also I hate the Patriots, you're just being an idiot."
True. Here the mistakes has already been made. Please don't mess up for us who are looking for an alternative refuge to Israel.
I think it depends on the combo whether you can block or not. Right? Sometimes blocking works other times not so much.
You're not. OP just couldn't follow some of the simplest rules on reddit.

But realistically if you’re expecting fine dining at any airport you’re probably kidding yourself. Sustenance without food poisoning is about the best you can hope for.
"No or low contact. I don't have time for ""family"" that doesn't have basic courtesy for me. "
[NAME] looking like his fucking controller disconnected
Memorialising is fine but he is just spamming the sub

I remember saying [NAME] messed up the timeline worse than [NAME] over a year ago
YES! Especially when I’m high 😭 spent like over $500 in December alone
"Oh boy.. ""The Beginner's Guide"" game on steam had me messed up for a couple days.."
I remember the last protest we hid against these guys. Scum bags

"Tried so hard and got so far, in the end it doesnt even matter"
I don't think any [RELIGION] woman would care about such a thing. If they did then they have their own problems.
I'd imagine they're mostly fakes. You'd be uncomfortably warm in a real CG Parka in our climate.

So I've just read your whole post. Wow. Your mum is a piece of work.
This is what I want the most now that [NAME] is out but I think we live in a NO world

Threatening to drive your sisters into the ocean is illegal. It's called making a terroristic threat or menacing and can cause her to lose access to your sisters
A better description would be she got a nasty fright rather than it being terrifying.
oh! I have more ships this time! Niice!
I think peach is hotter but not her attitude ha
"wow that’s really some hate there. I hated [NAME] in the Office too, but he got okay since the third run"
Damn I never had to wait that long. Then again where I live is a town more than a city so much less busy etc
Its not better then PoE.....by a longshot.
Two or three anti depressants before I told them a lie about how I tried my moms valium and it worked
I would not recommend contacting her. That would probably creep her out.
Yes no one wants to believe my religion and how to make people happy so it makes me sad

Wonder if it’s possible for [NAME] to engage with a polite fan in a magnanimous way.
"I'm not covering for anybody, trump included."
Censoring criticism and discussion is a very slippery slope.

Love the almost sharingan look he gets in his eyes right before the attempt. O-O I CAN SEE!
It's also ridiculously removed from reality. Dying to a disease or injury from an accident is orders of magnitude more likely than getting shot.
I would like to suggest one that's like Would You Rather. More of a dark comedy but oh so good. Cheap Thrills is amazing
Quit being racist. They're just being racists.

I really enjoy “good life project” podcast by [NAME]
"The amount of times this happened during the first tides of war event, smh."
"sometimes it feels like a lot of characters are like that, but only when I fight them"
I never said anything. I’m just cynical that change can happen when there is so much money on the line. Decisions are bought not made.
"Really? Edit: Ah yea, I saw the original one. It still reminds me of Wind Maker."
I'm so happy this post blew up because this is so true
It's shameful how this sub sold out to Big Broccoli (TM).
"Lifesite “News” doxxed him. That website is just pure hatred distilled, it’s disgusting."
Context doesn’t exactly make state murder of the “stupid poor” better.
"I don’t think you can be compelled to testify against someone else over a traffic violation, I would just feign ignorance"
"Teacher: Huh, I never though he'd really do that."
Does anyone here think this will actually turn the Jet's around? I feel like this is the worst shit ever.
"IT MUST WOUND YOUR PRIDE! STANDING OUT THERE, LIKE A GLORIFIED SENTRY!"
"How offensive. I, am NOT a duck!"
"But tbh, i dont think i am disgusting, but my feet still get smelly after a while "
"I can only download games using SteamCMD at work at the moment, so yeah, glad I could buy it before the shutdown"
Once upon a time I got banned for a whole day because of bad behavior... Oh wait that was all of us...
We did it guys! We’re the real heroes!
This person is a god damn idiot
"Sorry to hear that, I have it for ps4 and hardcore dlc servers are still up"
Thanks now I gotta go listen to golden earring
Right? I hear too many horror stories of people ordering online and not getting the copy on the release date. I would be so pissed.
These aren’t /u/ These are just their nicknames. They’ll know who they are when they read it and that’s what matters.
So you just don't believe we should have non-profit organizations. I guess that's consistent at least.
Middle Eastern here and watching this team lose due to silly mistakes at 3-4 am kills me
"Saying ""don't come into this subreddit just to start arguments about politics"" isn't intolerance."
My target has lots of stuff. *This target had fortnite.*
Had to pause for a sec to properly cringe when [NAME] says why he got sent to the school. Whyyyyy would you *announce* that oh my [NAME]
"Wow, the JCS twitter account made the photo of [NAME] with his TSK counterpart **their banner**."
"Yes, is there any way we can do this? Cos fuck that POS."
"He also had bipolar depression, which was a major driver in his mental states..."
Work on your anxiety and self-esteem. Do things for YOU. Love yourself.
I told you I'm not in the mood for a snog tonight!
Nukeville sounds like a nicer neighborhood. Like no broken and burnt houses and like children playing in the street and people having barbecues
I hate this arm swing thing. Either try to sync up or just stop doing it.
It was [NAME] I think? And I only remember because I was surprised and then disappointed.
Thank you. I needed someone else to say it. The unnecessary misgender as a parting shot wasn't my favorite either.
"Well, supposedly [NAME] wrote TPM in only a couple days, and people hated it."
"Even if I did, no one would believe me....,"
Oh my lord I am so sorry. That is just despicable. Internet hugs.

"the sky, living a happy and amazing life in the clouds."
Or just some kind of pushback. Your best player getting injured on a questionable play; no physical retribution; getting shutout - pick 2.

I don't even find her that loud or that wild I think he's just no fun.

I'm afraid you have your terms mixed up -
8 His morality is depraved. 9 His brutality is indulgent. 10 His religion is repudiated. 11 His existence is nullified. 12 His believers are mistaken.
He must smell terrible when he sweats. That's honestly pretty gross.
My brother fell asleep on the beach once and his whole back turned purple from sunburn and yours is still worse than his! My [NAME]!!
Ok so this doesn't seem like a cover given they made a whole comp for him
The bone around your tooth it’s subject to fracture when you take bisphosphantes! Super weird.

"Matchroom squad dismiss [NAME] as not existing anymore, the sky media influence is scary "
My hair never scrunched and I was so jealous
[NAME] is bad & anyone who still supports him should feel bad for it.
>both parties are dumb >stupid tribalism 🤔🤔🤔
It is weird to be having sex at all at 15.

"Wow, you really missed the point, didn't you?"

Unrelated but wow I’m so proud that I can read like 70-80 percent of this because I studied Chinese for 3 years. 加油！在中国你做什么？
Omg I did the same exact thing LOL
It does take time. I made the mistake of letting toxic people back into my life and regreted it. They don't change.
I love Rocket Love and Blasted. I just wonder who the songs were written for because these are all reference tracks except Acura Intergul

I almost didn't finish this stranger mission because I just *knew* it was going to be bad.
I have tried and succeeded. You’ve just had bad luck my friend.
Love the whole lebatard community but she has the most confidence speaking and it shows up on all the shows she does
"The government won't let scientists do studies on it, so we're stuck with anecdata until they stop being assholes."
"There’s no evidence that 12-step programs work any better than no program, so you’re not missing anything if you quit. Good luck."
Solid argument. Honestly this game’s a mess and impossible to balance for both sides equally.
"Well, I knew that a lot of people don't trim their bushes in the eastern suburbs, but that's ridiculous."
And pizza. Don't forget pizza. The roof of my mouth feels like a battlefield after I have eaten a hot pizza.
My name is [NAME] too. It's so strange hearing my favorite bravolebs say it on TV.
Why did we have [NAME] that one year shoot against Draymond. I dunno because its entertainment and story lines.
"Reminds me to the movie [NAME]. ""I saw it in a movie, it will work!"""
At least she had a great experience

This is so aesthetically pleasing. Wow. And yum!
"I’m curious, do any other coaches do this?"
The fact she'd want her daughter with someone as awful as [NAME] is strange. And what's wrong with [NAME] that she would stay with him ?

Seems like an odd hypothetical question to ask.
“I love food! Or “I’m a foodie!”
"Except for all those companies brushed off in the ""and many more"" category. Wasn't as lucrative for them. "
This is just a stupid question. The answer is who cares? [NAME] is on an entirely different level from [NAME].
"Obviously he has not adhered to his promises, however what I noticed is this is basically the same message that [NAME] had."
Nice! I’m glad you liked it. Have fun exploring :)
Following in the long tradition of network cop shows. Dat [NAME] ass tho.
Oh shit right. I forgot about that wonderfully horrible fact haha.
Ok well I hate to break it to you but I'm a magical pink unicorn...posting something on the internet does not make it true

What a cuck! But the sword and steal the groceries!
"I can only speak from my experiences, but I have [NAME] and 3 siblings, 2 of which are extremely social."
"Tell him, that just as he has a very shy person and I told her just to get a pretty woman with a strapon."
Don't know how that was missed. Tragic really. Considering the title.
I fail to see the downside of that.
Stop all the bullshit. Keep AB. Pick one.
"That's certainly one part of the puzzle, though arguably they are non-noahide as they historically advocated for incest marriage, but maybe it is different now."

"That’s too bad, I didn’t know that."
Yeah keep filming your kid kicking a dog in the face. I'm suprised this isn't on r/funny

Imma upvote the hell outta this. I’m saying this as a Flamer fan

All I can think of is her sweaty mom cooking away in the back 🤮
"Maybe he has really bad short term memory, and is genuinely curious how the cop got his attention."
It's actually insane how she looks like [NAME].

"I have no idea who those people are, but I've heard their names a lot."
"""I didn't learn anything from the last short clip video on twitter that cut in mid way through an confrontation"" Oh look a new one!"

"You hit the nail on the head, my friend."
But once again that is a problem with the people. So many just attack the people who disagree instead of the arguments.
I read it as him taking her virginity. Raping her...unless it was consensual and she WANTED to lose it.

I went to the avenues once. I was murdered twice in one day and they stole my grandma's jewellery from her grave in Minnesota!

He’d go down with a mysterious season ending injury
She already had a child protection worker. It wasn’t her first rodeo sadly.
Aw thank you! Glad you enjoyed it :)
Only 7? Wow he's slacking. He must not have very faithful parishioners.
your first mistake was trying to make something look presentable while serving it in a tupperware

Just read the text of this amendment. I am literally sick to my stomach from reading this. THIS MUST NOT STAND!!
Much more badass than the union suit.
"Phsyically, not mentally or emotionally. It's literally only been one week since the end of episode 2 and the start of episode 3."
Just hanging out at UQ St Lucia is pretty cool.
Where'd you go tough guy? You were talking so big before. Way to downvote and move on punk.
another one of those chicks sacrificing her children for a man and 'happiness'

"Pls no, it's too cold outside to go hatless."
Good. We don't want more thrash liberal offspring in this world.
I gave up on the show over and over before I adopted 'just skip around'. Ended up finishing all of 3-6.
Offense does too. Love [NAME] but he's hurting our spacing being out there so much.
"This better be a troll because if not, you are the most obnoxious, self centered, asinine person on this face of this planet."

No stop. One Red and yellow team had to be sacrificed for the fortunes of the other. I’m sorry
I feel like this anime will make me cry in the end. Damn even its opening is full of drama. Am I correct in this?
"Talk is cheap, let’s see it on the court. [NAME] has been an awful offensive player this season & awful is kind. "
"Ok, thats my thinking too. If [NAME] really only gets 180 anyone who didn't make that deal (like us) is pretty dang foolish."
"I know you’re out there somewhere Beer Barron, and I’ll find you.... *no you won’t!*"
This was ten years ago...but I have faith in people to be nice. Knoxville was amazing when I lived there.
I both love and hate everything about this
I like how people are downvoting when this is how so many military coups have happened. I challenge those who downvote to prove me wrong
Cognitive dissonance. I don't support diagnosis via internet but she needs medical help NOT a medical license.
that doesn't make any sense at all.
look how the Islanders didn't let us get a good shot there do that devils defense
Welcome to the Wild West. It's fucking amazing.
Dude it was an old video. Your porn math is way off.
This must have been the fastest reply I've ever gotten omg

"Bioavailability is poor without an emulsifier, this is not a practical method of administration."
No. No it isn't. Its a bad sitcom joke.
That kinda happened to me at a chillibees once. I semi full on panicked. I grew to hate that place. And booths.
Sadly the minimum wage in Virginia is only $7.25 an hour so that definitely would not be enough.
The secondhand panic and embarrassment I feel from this is astounding
I wouldn’t recommend expensive brands in this subreddit. People get irrationally angry and condescending.
That's really creepy. What is crazy is that 9 year old's get cell phones now! Times have certainly changed :p.
I've got no place else to go...
Was going to watch this but now you've said that I won't - brutal going back to that given the recent highs.

Yeah so I got kicked from a group chat for gnoming people*
> So having sex is a medical condition? no but std's are
This will be me a year from now. Not fair at all.
Did she do it yet? I refuse to look.
Seeing that knife on this subreddit put the fear of [NAME] in me
[NAME] is garbage in every single game he plays. He needs to be traded
If you don't mind cutting your life opportunities by 3/4 go for it.
Yeah that last one made me hate her the most for some reason.
Wow i've sat like all of those

If you saw this pizza you'd have disagreed. Would have caused [NAME] to faint

This sub is very very bad at irony
"Man, I would cry tears of joy if my two-year-old cousin could just say my name, let alone say a coherent sentence."
Sure hope #4 includes subsidized housing. I'm terrified.
Don't think you should be nominated for Breakout and Best of the year but whatever.
... [NAME] derangement syndrome sufferer spotted. What drivel you crazy lunatics say... The lies and falsehoods along with the out of place fearmongering is getting really annoying...

Stunning considering you have the exact same opinion.
This makes me wonder if they fixed [NAME] having a very noticeable gap between her body and legs with her new shorts.
"Awesome, love the input! I totally get what you’re saying!"
I don't want to go to meet the kids yeeeet. Im not yet ready ;(
"Its the easiest subject in the whole school, they teach us stuff we should’ve learned when we were 11, it’s so bad..."
Luckily my wages are rising faster to compensate. Oh wait...
And this is why men are so against #believewoman
It's the hard R that'll get you in trouble.
He is sacrificing himself for our sins. [NAME] bless.
"Not for me. The ankle area is the least painful, compared to the rest of your body "
[NAME] just wants to post pics of her facetuned of herself for attention while acting morally superior to those other girls. fuck off
I sleep alone on the floor. That was a bad idea...
I don't know why this image bothers me so much
"Yup, cats can you think it could get the correct call. The US and holy shit how do you know there are too brittle."
"I just don’t like traversing through the snow, and how the salt stains some of my boots, and the mess it leaves at home."

You miss the sidewalk wing massacres as well I'd bet
They're wrong I don't like math and I'm still ugly
"I’m surprised it was uploaded today, especially since he uploaded a video just a few hours ago"
This is incredible. I love this album so much. Everybody wants to rule the world is so good.
You spend most of your time here in the Rangers threads talking about how much you hate the huns. That's pretty weird as well.
Wow she said that? Let me just #red flag
The Cavs didn’t even want [NAME]. They just wanted to fuck with us.
"Sorry man, it's not gonna happen. The music needs to be remastered for vinyl specifically and that's more than your budget."
You’re funny if you think 27 vs 1 is going to somehow end in a good deal for the UK.
Wack. Oh heard some 17 year olds are doing it too.
"To be fair, it is a wild sentence. ""I have genital herpes and a BMI of 31."" As if they're related lol"
">They played three games in a week three separate times. [NAME], that's absolutely brutal"
I'm surprised [NAME] hasn't had a chance to be called up
I’m currently doing a 3 day fast and omg this is not helping 🤤
I’m just gonna go ahead and call bullshit on most of the details of this story.
Find like-minded people you can have meaningful conversations with. Everything else I consider a waste of my spare time.

The impact of his head hitting the court looked so bad. I hope he'll recover from this.
"Honestly, fuck [NAME] after the bounty gate shit"
If you’re that disassociated with reality then it doesn’t matter
I'm sorry but data and facts are more important than the emotional experience of having lived through something.
"Oh, grilled nuggets. Haven't really seen those at fast food places so I thought they were just the regular nuggets"
[NAME] doesn’t care if you drink tea. I would tell him how you feel. Keeping you in my thoughts.
He’s cowering in the corner. My only pet!
I spent a few months in LA and it freaked me out every time someone zoomed past me.

That's what you get for being a drama queen.
"Wow, that's quite a depressing article. I agree with points being made, but slow down with the doom and gloom."
"Dude I don’t even know what that guys deal is, but honestly, I feel bad for him"

Also put icecream under the taco for a nice sundae suprise 👍
My 47 year old sister is still creeped out by the original theme show's music. She refuses to watch it.
I’ve made candies almonds and cashews in a slow cooker before. They’re surprisingly not mushy or soggy.
This just reminded me to continue designing that bloody website.

And then you can commit felony credit card fraud because they rejected you
Omg I did the same exact thing LOL
I don't know about the rain but my friend suggested that it could look a tiny bit like Malachor.
That’s up for debate...you won’t be able to pick it up after the first two episodes.
Oh shit. Is back?! Time to import
Two natural right backs is fine. Then the pretend one doesn't have to pretend anymore.

OMG. How have a I never heard this before? Absolutely dying. You can tell [NAME] just lost it off mic. 🤣
"> mined the worldwide largest block It was orphaned, so no they were unsuccessful, even when they filled the block with their own hidden txns."
FYI not all skinheads are racists. [NAME] suck and should be confronted.
Thats fair. I know its a joke it just always struck me as odd how people wrote it off. No worries.
It just feels nice to share uplifting energy with people.
I thought this allegation was squashed when it came out. I was surprised to see it still making headlines. Poor guy.
Fuck her... don’t live to make your parents happy
"[NAME], that uniform. At least the Nazi [NAME] had decent fashion sense. This is a crime against fashion"

Just what I need; a video of my commute to work so I can enjoy the experience in my free time.
It's not so uplifting that it's guaranteed to die in the Senate...
I almost thought this was gonna turn into a story of your tissue you'd been reusing for months. I'm glad it was not lol
I would say they do because it was a horrible accident but they were also in the wrong. The military tried to get them to disperse they didnt.
It’s definitely a massive problem for both of us. Attributing blame does nothing to solve the problem.
Ahh you must be speaking of M & W Industries! I know it well I'll never forget the smell of pickles.
The DNC effectively *was* lead by [NAME]... That was the problem.
Me too. At least we acknowledge what we are and don't make up excuses in that regard.

I think this is the first time I’ve ever seen this joke.
They didn't play it safe. They played it big and failed hard. The plot is too damn big for a soft-reboot game.-* +
Made by [NAME] who also was involved with Sacred Games so I think you'll enjoy it.
Oh my god Del Monico. Horrific. Even the ambient smell in the hallways makes me gag.
Running a company will be the same disappointment. Your problem is unsolved.
How am I arguing? I thought it was pretty clear I'm asking how something works in what I presume is a different county.
"It can get ridiculous ,too. She'll actually yell out ""stop yelling!!!"" when she's the only one yelling."
Yes. The citizen received no “direct benefit or gain”. This is being looked at like someone paying for our lunch.

My wife would say that all of the above and another dozen more are cheating...and she wonders why I’ve fucked other women...
Market ≠ Capitalism Just because something operates within the Capitalist system doesn't make it Capitalist. Just because [NAME] was (supposedly) elected didn't make him democratic

"Suffice it to say, I understand why you want to build one, although I disagree with both the solution and how you arrived at the conclusion. "
No I dont think I said that anywhere
Opposing ethnonationalism and private property is hardly a weird hill for an anarchism to defend
I can't tell you how happy I am that [NAME] and [NAME] are Polynesian Sauce guys.
"Was already mad when it wasn’t center. Then when it got knock over, i was furious. Damn machine has no brains."
This is so wholesome I love it
"Didn't realize they were shipping the challenge coins with Israeli FAL rifles, that makes this whole thing even weirder."
"*me Doesn't make any sense if your anxiety is afraid of these things, since it would be scared and go away then. "
That's way dangerous to keep then together they may break out and start feedig on the other ear buds to gain heir strength
"They played a lot worse on Saturday. Saturday was really, really bad for me."
"You’re a damn good grandma, good wishes for your grandson and good luck!"
"Mate you are mental, no way [NAME] would mess up like you have said!"
Sorry you had to live there. Good news is they are demolishing it in 2020.
The SJW community. I hate it too cause they are the ancestors of the Civil Rights Movement who where absolutely awesome
"And any form of bottom up government is also extremely susceptible to corruption. Basically, humans suck. "
"Wait, am I the only one who thought [NAME] was the tallest since childhood? "
Your son went to school in a treehouse?
I just looked that up... Dear [NAME] why?
"I think it's hilarious you guys think this will ""help"" [NAME] Yeah [NAME] was bad, but [NAME] didn't show very much either"
What crap An issue with developing on byte ball is that no one knows what the bloody hell byte ball is
Some of us can't do syrup any more. :(
Ouch! My hear sank. Don’t do this to me.
"Man I am so happy for [NAME], they are selling out. Personally there is no way I would be able to afford them for 38$"
I bought milk and honey for its cover. ended up loving it anyway.
I'm using mine on the Consumer Cellular customers that come in mad at me because they have to set up an Apple Account to use their IPhone.
Shared misery *always* makes me feel better :D
Whataburger misses you too. Come back and visit when you can!
"I hope barely anyone watches it, it's so aggressive, full of cringe and makes him look childish"
I’m so homesick and I come here for photos like this.
It's impossible for communism to exist without a state.
>if your car is so great why do you have to fill it with petrol all the time This is how stupid you sound
He said i am being rude to her
ROI for that is too low. Truth is customers are willing to put up with shitty employees.
I suppose all the other [NAME] dont count as competition
> Love is more important than some job. You can't be serious? Please tell me you're just joking.
What’s the clip from? I’m scared to put “teen boy good kisser 900 number” into YouTube
No worries. Just giving you a hard time!
I'm a woman and I lost mine at 26 (was just a later bloomer) This obsession with virginity is odd.
"6lbs is a lap dog, if someone shoots that cause they're scared it's aggressive..."
Your old enough to call the police. Don't let him put hands on you again.
"I have [NAME] hat so I could marry it, flip it and kill it"
Other than the [NAME] storyline and the flashbacks the stories building up to the main villain went in circles. Wasn’t anything exciting or to interesting.
"Explain why you think it’s not. Not that I disagree, but explain your thoughts."
"that's ace, thank you so much "
No you don't. The average opinion of ISIS for example is way below zero.
Its to bad he doesn’t give Tomlin this treatment.
you're talking about [NAME] like your a child and your dad said something that you don't have the ability to apply with nuance.
"I just came home, what the fuck is this lineup? I love you [NAME] you mad bastard !!!"
Can't make negative comments about her on here dude. Downvotes incoming

I like being bad. It makes me happy.
"Umm, I don’t think empathy means what you think it means...🤷‍♀️"
"This team was nowhere near legendary, filled with legends sure, but incredibly disappointing."
Not everyone left of you is a lib. You're arrogant.
Interesting. I recognize way more of the 2019 names than I did from last year. Any hope that means I'm getting younger?!
"It looks fun as hell too, from what I can tell. I’d love to give it a whirl"
That’s horrible. Only religion could make an otherwise normal person want to show a torture and murder video to a child.
"Man, [NAME] really turned insane, huh. What a shame, man..."
I wish they didn’t hate [NAME] so much. Feels bad to play her.
It was never implied as such. You simply mistakenly interpreted it that way.
I feel bad for that other little girl that was the only one not to get a puck
Had a whole grilled lamb at an Indian restaurant once for a corporate event. It was amazing
The girl on the right got glass stuck in her leg poor girl
if they did I'd expect it'd be 50% more than a local store. The prices in their duty free are generally bad
Hahaha thanks for sharing that is simply amazing. You probably gave the buyer a good laugh too.
I actually choose to teach an extra class so I can avoid lunch duty. I hate it.
Not the fact that it's a terrible comparison?
I’m also glad I’m not the only one that swears a lot at the bastard objects.
And [NAME] and [NAME] played when goalies were not as good
"I went through that phase, I was quite depressed. "
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **2nd Cakeday** yosoyjackiejorpjomp! ^(hug)
There are no helpful ideas like the one you're looking for. There is only one idea... Tell your parents and get authorities involved.
I meant I wouldn't bring up wanting it to be vanilla and changing terms.
I feel like they're blaming the school for them doing exactly the right thing.
Correct What the fuck is the AAF is what im asking.
"They are having a whole bunch of problems , maybe they are paying so the state doesn't go after them as well."
Dance with the devil by immortal technique Honestly one of the most messed up rap songs they will ever hear.
Good. I want them to remain crazed. More winning for us.
"Don't worry, [NAME]. Her idea of wit is nothing more than an incisive observation humorously phrased and delivered with impeccable timing."
HOLY HELL THATS HELL OF A BURN
Yea the refs weren't terrible all game or anything
"Headline had me thinking the guy was currently barricaded in a BK bathroom, demanding they give him free food. But no."
Clear disregard for the Turf Protection Act:
I admit I’ll be fairly happy if we continue to invest in young internationals and sign a $100+ mil free agent every offseason.
"yeah it's not like the subreddit is filled with that super-unique criticism . ""anyone who disagrees with me is a fanboy!!"""
It's not his job to train you.
Stop the speed. It does that to you
"Im at the game,somebody please put me out of my misery "
"Or don't notify the boss, and keep not singing Happy birthday in restaurants. (Maybe I'm just no fun?)"
So you lucky you won as you work illegal teach. Glad you leave.
"Can't let it get to you. You tried, got rejected, so move on.. Believe me I know it's discouraging but everyone gets rejected. "
The emojis in the background. Wtf lmao
That would be a huge mistake on WWEs part.
I had no idea someone could actually be this stupid. > capitalism.
"""You look a little older without your clothes on"" - [NAME]"
Hmm... I don't think EPCOR is the reason the oilers suck
I can’t look at [NAME] with this hair!
No. Can’t wait till it’s legal here
I think the flairs get removed if a team hasn't been to a major in a certain amount of time. Don't quote me on that though.
His Batman/TMNT book is a really fun read with great art.
"Thank you. Let’s not blame one parent only for the existence of a child, or the batshitness of one coparent. "
Man I didn't think our fanbase was this delusional.
"On being 3x over the speed limit while under the influence, that alone makes him very guilty of something wrong. Thanks for the additional information."
"Wow, you folks sure are salty about losing the midterms! Pathetic?"
"Boy, I literally didn't expect anyone to respond to this. Thanks, internet! I feel a tiny bit less alone."
"Which is why he's still in the league as a red zone threat, but the days of 1,300 yards 12 TDs are long gone."
Seriously? In Dutch right? Because... he's so awkward on his YouTubes in English.
Yasssss. I loathed Harry Potter. Book? Movie? Toy? Board game? Costume?
"No,no, you are right we should murder everyone we hate other wise hateful people win. "
Just get pissed next time he asks and tell him to fuck off Some people just think they can take advantage of people who help them
"Hey now, don’t try to have the guy killed. This is an upstanding sub. "
Time to cut him off. Or find a way to get him good help. Cause he sounds a little dangerous.
But it saved people with even more money lots of money. The owners of the teams.
I’m cool with anything that pisses off someone as disingenuous as you.
My heart is breaking for that little girl.
That knife looks awfully familiar... *snorting and claw clicking in the distance*
[NAME]. [NAME] and [NAME] just style on these scrubs with fucking mecha Tai Chi.
You are a unique woman. Happy for you that you found someone who suits you so well.
You're not. OP just couldn't follow some of the simplest rules on reddit.
You will give her your arm and next day she you will give you the cold shoulder. Please just run!
Sorry if this is ignorant but is that a wig?
wow so almost every sub has grown a lot in 7 months. Also 8.3k!! what!? that's insane
"You just made my point, you obnoxious whining kid"
I’m cool with anything that pisses off someone as disingenuous as you.
All those statistics are nonsense. There has never been “true” capitalism.
I will downvote the hell out of any news article promoting ponzi schemes.
"Oh, the ""Thomas the nuclear bomb""? That scarred me."
Aw poor kid. At least he has a bomb-ass name. Too bad he probably doesn't remember it anymore.
"I'm shocked you still have service. Mine doesn't play, they are cold. "
I make all my coffee at home because I don't like wasting money unless it's free at the bank
"Irrelevant what is deserved, as if that's objective. The only thing that matters are the facts and they don't support a move like this."
Wait theres rats!!!??? Im calling health and safty!
This is infuriating but what’s also infuriating is missing all of our chances and players being constantly in offsides positions
"Right, but we want to shit talk them directly. Not agree with other people shit talking them."
"But the guage isn't usable in matchmaking and all items, including smash balls are typically off."
And it was out of their control as well for both. That's funny
"She'll ask them a question, interrupt them to say that something else is coming up and then talk about something irrelevant. She is all over the place."
Ok I tried to search the sub... is it too late to get a flair? It won’t work for me
"An imaginary god won't make you feel better, that's right, just the one true Living and Eternal God of Great Mercy who loves you."
It’s not so much that I enjoy money and more that I do enjoy scamming people.
"If only I could figure out how. I'm trying, but to no avail. "
Didn't find it believable even from the start
I constantly feel like I'm my husband's best friend and it's just a matter of time until we break up :(
The best losers of grand finals cod has ever seen
"C1,2 7.30 pm [NAME] to [NAME], ""I how how you can throw down"" HAHAHA!!! "
Plymouth: Confederate flags Diesel pick up trucks Dead factories Heart disease and disappointment
"Short answer, you can’t. Your making that sacrifice"
This is amazing and exactly how I feel about him. I love [NAME] and [NAME] but this is why Nuge is my favourite NUGE IS HUUUUUUUGE
"Hey, you can make baseless claims if you want. Don’t expect people to just believe you though."
The funny/awful part is how well [NAME] works photoshopped in.
No. We wouldn’t have enough room to play them all and each of them would add like 10-15 mill in luxury tax. EACH.
Thanks - Glad I did not waste the money / gold
Stupid [NAME] is playing into the Church's hands. What an idiot. He has an amphetamine addiction.
"Yeah no, I don't support people being questioned by police for any opinion actually, a sentiment I expect many people on here share."
Wow 😮 you really convinced me... like gtfo here
Seeing the past doesn't mean being in the past
It's so really sad how praising the Creator ([NAME]) has become something associated with terrorism... Astaghfirullah.
"**Me yesterday:** Wow [NAME] and [NAME] are in a good spot **Me today:** So [NAME] probably gonna win this season, huh. "
A 12 million sub channel has value. Wouldn't be surprised if it's been hollowed out ready to be sold and rebranded.
> Imagine the ~~nightmare of regulation~~ flood of unregulated money these guys are up for- congrats.
"This feels more like ""Lofi Rock"" if that exists, or even Jazz. Very interesting."
Somebody has got to be a parent lol
I called an ambulance for my friend without knowing it was against her wishes. She never blamed me but I felt really bad about it.
I don’t know where you live but in my area people don’t really care to have a good-faith conversation with an anarchist.
I think OD needs a rework. Get rid of that crappy 50% passive and give him some sort of active or a proper passive ability.
I mean a blowout isn’t really enjoyable.
Interesting that [NAME] is closer to [NAME] in terms of efficiency compared to [NAME]. We give him too much shit.
She would betray her friends for chicken nuggets
I hate those days man... So triggering
"Ugh I live in WA state and now I'm scared I'm going to get measles even though I'm vaccinated, I hate anti-vaxxers"
biological gender isn't real. it's biological sex. do some research
"That used to be my favorite view on the planet, but now it’s just rage. I can’t look anymore."
Nope I’m not exposing my kinks to Reddit 😂
I'm seeing the error using Chrome both on MacOs Desktop and Android. I'm glad it seems to just be me though. Apologies for the snarkiness.
This is not looking good for China's typical method of say whatever the other side wants to hear then do nothing.
Perfect example of the disgusting misuse of ‘Orwellian’ on this website
I would hate to see another [NAME] situation where [NAME] gets hurt again because he wasn't fully recovered.
"Yep, first hour free at long term. But if you go a SECOND over that you owe them $19.80 ! They're fucking ruthless"
I still maintain the packers were a worse team this year.
Buncha people having (admittedly loud) fun. Don’t really see the issue.
The third period is going to be uncomfortable and I preemptively hate it.
Wow grats man. Hopefully I can use this inspiration for myself tomorrow. If there was something new you learned in this experience would share it?
Actually there were blacks in the SS. Kind of an odd analogy.
"This video was uploaded in October 2013, over five years ago now. This just feels like an unnecessarily inflammatory post for karma to me."
"shouldnt be driving baked anyways. even if you think you can, gives us stoners a bad rap"
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** SirVortivask! ^(hug)
Wow so glad [NAME] is getting it done quicker. Better for later in tourney
Then it'll hurt more when I kick it in the balls.
"Oh no, the gig is up. I'm really [NAME]. LOL"
"Once again if you base your worth/purpose on some base primal act, you're pathetic"
"Amazing bot, you’re doing great sweetie "
Wow [NAME] retained NO combat skills from the time he was [NAME] to help him fight Cicada at that bar
I love this!! And it’s so true
I sure hope so. I wanna cry tears of joy knowing [NAME] and [NAME] rode off into the sunset with one last ring.
If it’s so in demands why are you posting that you can only get unpaid internships
I really want to find a female version of him and ship them both
Really? Shucks! I’ve never seen it...thought it was a perfect add. My bad.
"My childhood horse died due to twisted intestines. Very traumatizing, since he crawled over and put his head in my lap at the end."
I swear these people would try to sell shoes to someone without feet.
"They’re both good towns. Personally, I prefer Westfield. It has a better downtown, better schools, and the traffic is less awful. "
[NAME] missed it solely because they've moved from the Rookies vs Sophomores format.
Avid Android user here. My Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 is by far the sexiest and fastest phone I have ever had. Such bliss when using it.
"By who? Hate the Flames all you want, but there's nobody competing for a wildcard spot that will ""dunk"" them in the first round"
The creativeness and flexibility goes away once you get out of gold.
"Ahhh, the old ""if you don't vote the way I do, you're a big dumb idiot"" gambit. "
"I love you so much. > **""putas""** Qué eres mi que? (don't how can i translate it)"
We got nowhere with that because you only drop one-liners and refuse to actually engage.
Seriously. I wonder if OP has seen some of the amazingly stupid faces that [NAME] and [NAME] make.
I still can't believe [NAME] actually gonna be in Smash.
"I might be alone here, but it was probably Blame Game. I don't think I heard a rap song with that much emotional intensity before."
"Wow, you weren't instantly downvoted hundreds of times. The omniscum must have had a salad once and got a protein deficancy."
your comment made me exhale slightly faster because it's great. lol.
I discovered this show on the cnn docuseries about the nineties. What a terrible idea for a show 😂😂
"Sorry, should have searched for the artist's name. Karma Decay is a lot less reliable than I thought it was."
Doubters. I'm still waiting on a status report of the 2 fluffers from a few weeks ago. WOOF!
"Very happy to hear that. I hope he keeps at it, and is open and honest with them."
"I can see how you feel , THIS DID NOT TEACH A CHILD TO RESPECT ANIMALS and im ashamed and upset honeslty no horse deserved that."
I can't wait to find out why this is inaccurate and I should hate the person who made this post and shower them with downvotes.
Plus there's this expectation/trope of flowers sent to workplace being a way for someone who's fucked up to apologize (which is icky as hell but whatever)
These people have absolutely no confidence in their ability to make a living. It’s pathetic.
the fact that [NAME] still exists is somehow the strangest thing about this
Next time something like this happens tell them it's illegal to pet a working service dog and they could be sent to jail for it
"He did. He needs the facial hair, and that haircut is horrible he should just shave it and start over."
"That's really sad to hear, I can't imagine. I'm wishing the best for you"

Happy Cake Day 5makes10fm! Dare to live the life you have dreamed for yourself. Go forward and make your dreams come true.
> since he was the one to take it away from [NAME] last season [NAME] didn't deserve it last season
"[NAME] has always intrigued me. Some people hate her, others love her. Same with [NAME]. Personally they're both my faves <3"
Ironic if an alt-right nutjob finally makes the alt-right nutjob mods finally mod. Maybe even cruelty can only take so much piss in its coffee.
"Lol it's a public sidewalk, I wouldn't call it their set "
Well don’t complain here about another media outlet lol
I DO NOT NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS this is what I tell my 3.5 year old on the daily
Whiskey isn't going to help. She should pray to [NAME] that another man comes and brings purpose to her life.
Hulu is awful for this. The volume on their commercials is deafening.
TIL the President is not an adult. Actually IL that a long time ago.
I'm glad people with such foresight are the first to find this place unaffordable. Good riddance.
"And when the 4th Quarter needed it most, it vanished!"
They should do it even harder now to spite you
I’m so sorry for your loss and even more sorry about your mothers shitty reaction. I hope you’re doing better. ❤️
"It's like an Arts school but with dangerous, easily weaponizable spells being flung all over the place!"
Hopefully they realize that anti-discrimination law is immoral and unconstitutional.
I perform nostril waxing. It is surprising hardly painful at all. Feels so much better too!
This is so cute and wholesome? How is this terrible
"I read this place obsessively and didn't see it, so I'm enjoying it and upvoting it anyway"
I wish this was because he was being demoted and we were getting a new DC
"Aw, I missed it :( . I really need to spend more time outside of the roundtable thread..."
More worried about the multi-trillion dollars in entitlement programs than 5$ on a wall.
Because I want to be with someone but no one wants to be with me.
"I'd say we are a role sub at best, sorry guys just telling the truth"
It was a screech of delight. I like this hire. Would let to get a good OC now.
I’m glad I was able to find a recipe that allowed me to use my Christmas Gift cast iron skillet.
"BOUNDARIES. have some boundaries. say no. don't go. this is frustrating to read, honestly. don't do things that you hate doing."
Don't worry about stupid people and you do whatever you want. Screw them kind of people.
"Hey, I'm not saying it's autotune. I'm just fucking around. That long sample gave me a good opportunity to improvise."
"The only thing worse than this guy, is an actual vegan lecturing random strangers on why meat is murder. "
"I hate this comment. More-so, I hate how likely this comment is to reach fruition. "
Wow what a fucking autist. Probably more effort into this shit than all people that hate on GS combined.
I would stay away from buying from msL. Just remember that [NAME] looks like [NAME] on there. Trying to make a change :-/
This isn’t a “someone” this is a company.

"Despite what you may feel about me, I’m happy you got that off your chest, I hope you feel better!"
"Blow me you feckless moron, I was out of state. "
My point was that there is no good vote here. This is legislative battle over wall funding and any given vote makes sense only in that context.
"I can't find year stats. Anyhow, I needed the Excel files or a list of numbers in a table."
[NAME] was the same in Crestwood. Scary as hell.
And I never had the idea to keep anything. Too creepy. Maybe our multiple Liberator pillows....
"it will be the compilation of 3 games, don't get your expectations that high."
"Well, to them that probably was the polite term! That's funny though lol"
SE 89th just north of Brooklyn St is one of the worst I've driven.

I hate to say this but I love the drama around this all.... idk. My life is boring
"Damn, she was gonna clobber that punk with the butt of that gun."
This is how far the Broncos have fallen. They no longer command the best and the brightest. Now it's .500 retreads. This should be concerning.
Oh no! We better stop now...before someone's feelings get hurt!
Yup. I don't want to soil the paper unless I have something very interesting to write about.
"Even assuming that it's possible to take nothing, god DAMN I feel bad for anyone that has to look at the second dude's head during sex"

"Roll survival check! Ooh, a nat 1, sorry kid"
"Glucose guardian!!!! Salmonblue, you are doing amazing sweetie."
Doesn't suck nearly as bad as Metropolitan Grill. I'm surprised that place is still open.
My heart is breaking for that little girl.
Oh [NAME] if you ever burn anything you will never live it down.
Submit yourself to science to investigate this intriguing event.
And they wonder why they don't seem trustworthy. Maybe someone should tweet about it and they'd notice.
"Turns out, that daddys little girl is a thot, who also takes drugs. No wonder she fled her country."
Sad because you don't get any women?
"If your maternal grandmother is [RELIGION], so are you. Not having ceremonies doesn't change that."

Just read the text of this amendment. I am literally sick to my stomach from reading this. THIS MUST NOT STAND!!
Nooooooooo I was a student staff member at the WCC and this makes me so sad and angryyyyy
I'm a guy and I'm squirming. My wife asked me what the hell I was reading and I told her. She said wtf really loud.
"My bad, I guess I should've read the whole thing, from opiate yes "
I am vuri disappointed in you. You gained turdy pounds tis munt. Scale dont lie

"I understand why he's confused but [NAME] is the host of the show, he can't just leave"
"YOUR momentum doesn't help you, its the direction you're aiming and THEIR momentum that does. they were probably backing up when that happened."
"I have no clue what that is, but I hope you have fun"
Fun fact: [NAME] decided to delete an entire string of comments after mine because they made him look like more of a man-child than he already is ;)
"Couldn’t agree more, and glad there are folks in the media that recognize this"
Maybe you'll get lucky and it will fall apart before they go through with it.
I didn't know [NAME] was in a j rock band
"Seriously, way to miss the point. Even if no liquid falls from their eyes, they suffer immensely."
[NAME] why did they have to remove the OP? Her story is heartbreaking and she appears to only want some sort of comfort from the sub.
"This sounds an awful lot like a solicitation. In case it isn't, what you seek may exist but you'd probably have better luck with the lottery."
"No, this was changed years ago. Schools don't lose funding."
And there I was blaming the poor black lads
I’ve only been there once but really enjoyed it!! But I think it’s missing a pool table ;)
Now THAT is a murder by words!
I love having twins. They'll keep each other company in their room until about 7:30-8:00 every day. So nice.
This is going to be the last episode with my Latina goddess [NAME] 🌹😭
No we're getting Kinsler and be happy with it
Why does the feminization of a title belittle the role? I truly don't get it.
It would be nice...but there arent any within 70 miles of me. Not even one in my home state.
Glad to hear it. You deserve your best life without that abuse and negativity.
"What's the name of it? I googled Anker and there are several, but I want an included SD lol"
No I know. This group has been mostly helpful. And the rude comments were deleted by the mods.
"Funny enough, there is a five guys. I don't think the government knows it's American."
"It’s really 90%, which is what the customer is told. Corporate isn’t real smart when it comes to signage. "

Funny coming from the party that is #1 in killing babies.
"Does Instagram and Facebook have these nested ads/ articles? I’m not on social media enough to notice. Well Reddit, but I never see ads. "
"No I don’t, why can’t you bring your hand to do it?"
"Hey man, it’s hard out here for a cat!"
This isn’t even them not getting it. They just misread it as a whole! Why bro lmao
"I make lots of lists and none of them are useful. Except my playlists, I use them."
The sad part about this is that these memes are more Gen Z if anything...
"Of course they do, feminists are self-absorbed pigs that just want to control everything and never be held accountable for anything."
i wear all black. always. i died when we launched la boulange pastries. pink shirt of shame.
I’m gonna sit down and cry now
"The fact that you stayed this long really doesn’t but the blame on him, you chose this relationship "

[NAME] you’re such a shill for this FO it isn’t even funny anymore
"[NAME], it's like nobody learned a single thing from the game."
Oh [NAME] that's terrible. I hope things are better for you now.
Don't eat the [NAME] family. You shouldn't eat trash.
Weird combinaison of letters for french poeple
Yes I really miss his streams...the ONLY reason I chose adc as my main role was because of how chill chaox was.
Because it’s a lot for someone to handle and i haven’t had any outbursts etc that would’ve resulted from that
Too much sympathy in this thread for a creep who didn't get consent first. I'm glad he got humiliated on tv.

That would be the greatest night ever!
"[NAME] is my favorite character so I’m super happy they did what they did and I’m very happy she used her semblance, finally. "
Is that the only symptoms you’ve noticed? Are you normally worried for social situation?
>It is all about [NAME] I like how you brought up [NAME] and now your mad because people are calling you out for being wrong.
I prefer a good downdoot after a cup of coffee!
I just enjoy using intelligent words...? I left him
I wouldn't dance if nobody is watching! :)
The fact that this statement got downvoted shows how worthless some people on here are.
Aah I hope he's okay. So glad it's back! Time to get creeped out tonight.
Nope. And I don't even have a dog.
What the actual heck.... Like I just don't....I cannot
I miss [NAME] wish we could trade back for him!

I'll have to think about that one but maybe if you're down😂
"Im not a brexiter. In fact, this is my concern with a second referendum. I'm worried that remain will lose."
I don’t think that tells us any moralising lesson on the practice of incest.
Looks like one of mine too. Such a horribly raised entitled rude brat
It really is. I didn't know a thing about the feud and it caught me off guard how brutal it was. Enjoyed it a lot though.

This is about as unacceptable as the subject can get.
He doesn't He just want to get the F*** out of there.
It's not illegal to be ungrateful. You can't force someone to take care of someone like you're wanting.

I'm surprised no one's talking about the guy in the picture. What a thrussy!
I don't like [NAME] but I'd never wish this fate to any parent.

"What's old is dumb ass ""durr both sides"" arguments that require absolutely zero thought to make."
"You're didn't vote for her you are obviously a racist, sexist, homophobe, you're the worst kinda person."
Very sad. It’s the child I feel for most.

"They don’t like him, so he is divisive. It’s projection."
They do not need to. A majority of the vox populi think like you do.
I laughed harder than I should have at this reply. Then the sadness hit me when I realized it wasn't meant to be funny.
This is an uninformed and incorrect statement. It doesn’t take even close to that long.
Since when can a family member drive against other familymembers because you both own it? That would go horrible if that argument was valid! What the hell!

The fact that [NAME] was not mentioned in this thread confuses and upsets me.
I’m a fan of your awareness for others here. This sub needs more of that lately.

Look at that thing...could tear you to shreds
Damn it if that isn’t the most accurate description of growing up.
They very clearly state no new accounts can post. Yours is 2 weeks old and low karma.
I'm not going to try defend/explain their reasoning for why they think it will piss people off but that is why they use nazi symbolism.

LOL get it guys the joke is necrophilia 😂😂😂😂😂😂👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
I’m proud of you and I’m happy for you!

Not at all. I'm not going to argue with someone who doesn't understand what a strawman is.
Glad to see that [NAME] no more is a fellow r/Atheist user and anti-Peterson
im glad that's not what the game is about then
Wow are you saying political agitators will drum up a controlled crisis and disseminate the edited video through a foreign fake twitter account
"This is the sad truth for the exact reason he mentioned, they want a short fix to avoid doing this type of hard work."

This. Nurses already have one of the hardest jobs on the planet. They shouldn't have to waste time on this.
"Maybe. You're running the risk of the trolley and kids being stuck on the carriage with the mum at the previous station. But hey, free groceries!"
Somehow I feel like it needs an NSFW tag.
but the dayman doesn't have the nightman's sexy hands.
"Oh no that's so awkward, I don't understand how people don't understand how weird things like that are! "
Good news though. Yesterday the devs were running test server during the morning.

Oh I wouldn't be surprised my dad got away with some shocking things despite cps investigation but he was also white.
"Not sure wether to downvote because it's bad, or upvotes because that's the point"
It's weird how quickly I agreed with you. Usually I'da been more incredulous.
I don't believe that there's any justification for an authoritarian government.
Oh I know. [RELIGION] is the most severe form of brainwashing on the planet. There’s absolutely nothing like it. It blows my mind.
"Got a bit tipsy in my room alone, dancing in my underwear to some cheesy music for the whole night, and then cried myself to sleep"
Cordovan in the mech with the loudspeaker really makes me smile. It is just so bonkers. I love it.
I was scared of my room and even when I fell asleep in my bed I would sleep walk into my mom's room
Oh that's actually really interesting. So IQ of the general population would be a bell curve by definition?
He's a hypocrite like everyone else in his family and party.
No it takes at least 14 days and if she’s had her period it’s very unlikely she was pregnant before NYE
The orange man angers me and I do not like him.
The parents are “retards” for not watching their kid near water.
"I like it, especially the shovel and therapy lines"
Not what im saying im saying if you have a belly at all even a small one appendix carry is a difficult choice.

we just don’t match amazon at all to avoid this sort of thing.
"Most of the people commenting in /r/Libertarian aren't libertarians, but are just there to tell libertarians how stupid and evil they are."
I don't think any [RELIGION] woman would care about such a thing. If they did then they have their own problems.
Yikes. I feel sorry for the team that gives him anything above 5.5
You forgot to block the name in the tweet they're responding to
Now I'm worried that cat will get salmonella :(
I don't think eating 4chan pizza is a good idea. Unless you're into some weird shit.
"Smh. Can y’all stop being so hot? For real though congrats, you two look so happy together!"
“You have no clue what fascism is” Goes on to promote literal genocide tactics. You’re despicable

Had such a hard time cutting up the steak
Yeah it seems more like a joke than someone Bible thumping
This post is another reason why I'll never go back to Heroes. The loot box RNG was so cruel to me
"I'm pregnant! ""How dare you?!"" I love it."
Some additional background the robo-voice on that video is horrible.
That is so sad. So your sisters got to ruin their bodies and forego a career? Yikes.
Stop using that excuse he hasn't been dominant since returning
"My favorite social network is Tumblr, they left out this one too. Not exactly an obscure website..."
Everything's broken then. It's not like all other discourse is high minded and unemotional.
"Aren’t property owners responsible for clearing sidewalks in front? The bike lanes are part of the roadway, and thus under the city’s jurisdiction."
If you don’t think this can happen in the US your going to be the reason it does.
"Omg yes. Could you imagine? Pepperoni rolls, peach schnapps in a mason jar and beer cheese at dinner parties. Love it"
Over 2 years of prep time.... better use an agent next time!
Women can't do wrong you fucking mansplainer
It scares me that left to right is also possible for anyone
We need an irbe so bad right now. I hope [NAME] is that guy

I have a shirt with a picture that is very similar to this
Look at that subtle colouring. The tasteful thickness. Oh my [NAME]. It even has a watermark.
Have you ever consider knocking three times and that hide and seek/stalker vibe is terrifying. It's the most disturbing thing I can link you my AR 15.
Yeah well first god says it’s an abomination. Also if people find out everyone will hate me and my parents will be extremely angry
Maybe you just don't like women that much...
"You made me cry. That rarely happens, it's like poetry. Someone gets me. Someone feels my pain. Thank you."

"Oh my bad, i didn't know, thanks for telling me!"
Ugh. Just legalize it already so this silliness can be put to an end.
You are not wrong. I have learned about myself alot while on drugs. Sometimes it's scarry when i find out how limited my mind is.
When is that? There will always be supporters who don't support the players.
Can we put down weed bro? He’s faced too much suffering.
[NAME] expunged my paraphernalia without consent and I called the **LAW TIGERS** to sue him for damages.
ROI for that is too low. Truth is customers are willing to put up with shitty employees.
I watch it because I enjoy it
This is a restaurant in a hotel so it had a strange vibe.
"Oh no, are you going to be psychologically tormented and cry in the shower about it later? "
How did you try it if it's not live yet? There was no early access to it

Oh my goodness I was there yesterday! Luckily I didn't get bitten.
"It's already the 2nd here, but happy new years! 🎉"

We will never survive with 5% unemployment with moderate growth and a continued house building program to correct supply. Sounds horrendous
"2 is washed out, 6 and 10 are too dark. Also imgur showed me a bald naked chimpanzee right after your last picture and I nearly choked. "
More importantly the car shouldn’t have run him over but yeah I guess you’re right.
Wow can relationships be like this? That's amazing
I don’t think anyone would be offended by calling a group guys. But idk

Well the good news is once all the boomers die off you won't have any pesky old people to blame anymore.

Poor [NAME] looks so bored in the remakes.
"She haven't tried contacting me in 2 years, i guess she lied. Congrats to me, I won the 'miss you more' game. ):"
Talking about scary foreign people spreading disease is a classic xenophobic trope. Vile.
"I'm so sad for you, I'm so so sorry. 💔"
I didn't think I could love [NAME] any more. Is there a central repository for all of these battles
There were a surprising amount of surprised pikachus in this thread—thanks for the edit all the same.
one quick glance at your comment history negates any value in this comment
I bet you’re really fun at parties.
I really liked his answer to the QB success question. The Tebow part was also unintentionally hilarious.
"Im chill af, you complain about being adressed in the language of those you critique..."
I must of not fully understood what you meant... damn tired redditing
"Short answer, fuck no, don't ever fall for it. Don't make the same mistake Canada has."
Sooo inappropriate and sooo awkward. He looked so uncomfortable and [NAME] wouldn't stop. I hated watching that scene.
every time you see the snake edge and still get hit even though you *swear* you were holding downback
Blooming Villain with Willpower a close second. Heavily emotionally charged songs used at very dangerous events that suit the theme perfectly.
"Lost my only grandfather two years ago to Alzheimer's, this is great news knowingly this disease sucks"

After all that i expected it to not look terrible. Oh well.

He was shrieking at everything up until then. Like I said I was worried in the beginning but sometimes it works out.
"You are actually an idiot. Not it is not a proven fact, it is a biased stereotype. It is definitely derogatory. "

The title made me laugh so much after reading this. Glad things are going great with your wife. Many more happy years to you three (:
So PST it is. Glad we agree.
Hands down one of my favourite VA's and a main reason I go FemShep or play games she's in.
"Well, he was until season 3, which was ironically when [NAME] made them take that test."
But we're dynasty haters! We're just terrible people who don't love seeing bullshit shoved in our faces year and year out.

Wish they'd update Trapper's and Wraith's. They're so boring.
It's very hard to be an alcoholic drinking only beer.
Devastating to hear of any news like this :(
Yeah i checked her teeth out and they are okay. I was worried about that as well
So shocking a couple in their 20s in counseling isn’t going to work out.
I don’t think he forgot I think he was just really out of breath
Sadly no... I’m in Delaware 😩. But I’d love to help in any way I can. Keep me posted.

You mean like how Skyrim is only good because of all the mods? Lol
What's ridiculous is this stupid post and this asinine idea that white people are these constant victims
It’s the comment about smelling her that makes it pure cringe.
Looks like some salty Detroit fans downvoting you lol
I would say. ’good’ but it’s all fucking tragic.
Don’t like blood of the dead by the looks of it.
[NAME] could be so valuable if we didnt rely on him to create
"Pressure 7 targets/10 targets, popcorn, any tracking, and any tile frenzy because I enjoy trying to beat my highscore"
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to go with what he said about an hour ago. Unicorns. He just ruled out any sort of
It blows my mind that there are still people out there that think pot is more dangerous than alcohol.
"No, i'm arguing that if she calls someone disgusting for how they act it's wrong to act like the other person is an asshole for retaliating. "
You forgot to add how you hated your job or had a sick kid or some other sob story that changed once you met [NAME]
Box up all his stuff and put it outside the door
Can you stop living with this person? Engaging in it will only make it more toxic
Still a bit of redesign & this would look much better.
"Lol, ..probably not. But then again, i never wanted to know what blue waffles were and somehow i do. "
Seeing something like this without the usual “Wii music” is so... odd
This comment doesn't make sense. I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
"Jazz fan here. I completely feel. [NAME] cousins has more votes than [NAME], and [NAME] hasn't even stepped on the court this year"
"Yes, that was indeed the joke, I’m glad you got it ;)"
I feel like this happens to me every single time I shop there. I dont go in anymore because I'm tired of being followed.
[NAME] is a homophobic bigot and deserves to be attacked for acting on those beliefs.
"I did, I did!!!! Now I feel special "
"can't remember much of what happens. All I do remember is I was miserable. Good performances, but it was a bit dour for my taste."
Can you imagine the amount of backlash she’d get if it was ANOTHER [NAME] collab? Omg.
I just wish he got more screen time. Im enjoying this season but I feel like the huge cast of side characters get all the attention.
Cause as soon as he locked in execution he used the auto typing function immediately celebrating. Gets punished by karma and im the one down voted. Sure
"as a [NAME], trust me its not that great lol"
Last 30 seconds where [NAME] and [NAME] were silent to listen to the crowd gave me chills. Such a fun game and team! Aho is my dad
This wasn't him forcing her to get an abortion or breast implants dude like seriously you are being pretty ridiculous.
What a useless answer in this situation
"Damn, this hits close to home. Reddit is literally the only place where i can talk about personal stuff without being judged"
I am so very sorry that you are dealing with all of this
"Great. So increase prices 20% overall, give the waiters the extra money. I'm happy with that. 20% is a great tip."
"NO, HE SAID 77. BAKER IS GOING TO THROW 77."

That movie really scared me when I was a kid.

I'm so glad not to have Publix in my region when I see this bullshit...even though *I* miss their subs too... Lol
^ This. You know the guy's a liability when multiple teams openly admit to taking advantage of his defensive inconsistency at the left.
You also can’t prove it happened so logically this doesn’t exist and is a paradox that never happened therefore pi = 3.14159
Is it that common? Here on the tube on London there is barely room to breathe let alone spin so I guess we avoid this kind of crap
Thank [NAME] though! Imagine someone like that with kids... yikes
">Gotta love the South No. No, you really don’t. "
I'd argue they are advocating not fighting the fire in your house when the entire neighborhood is engulfed in flames.
How? They don't have SoundCloud or anything and it's usually played before you're killed.
Anyone else not like optics logo this year. The 2 greens look awful
It's weird to think of a functioning email account that's existed at the same time as the Twin Towers
If people don't act the way I want it is because they have bad reasons. Lol
"Better yet, get rid of them if they are non-essential. Why are my tax dollars paying for worthless jobs?"
That’s literally the stupidest thing ever If you think that what is stopping it to be applied to more than just bi-sexuality Seems a bit self destructive

You are so ugly even tears wont show up near you

Hell yeah. Enjoy your new bachelor life son!
I'd say [NAME] at 8 is pretty disrespectful
A lot of injury history for these players. I hate to count on them.
Omg!! They are kinda turning [NAME] into new [NAME].
"the fucking buffet part killed me, i always considered myself good at roasting but damn bro lmaoo"
"Psst, your spoiler tag is busted. Don't leave spaces between the ! and your text."
I wondered where the quote about “supporting your azz” and was very pleased to finally find the train wreck that said it.
Nope. Mac fix+ matte and Body Shop mattifying tea tree spray are the only ones that help my makeup.
Actually you're a [NAME] if you aren't for exterminating the 'wrong inherently evil and guilty race'.
It's not funny. Your neighbor doesn't sound very bright.
They could have prepared you better. I'm so sorry. I wanna give you a hug and tell you it's okay.
Seriously. Where I’m from it’s Heinz or excommunication.
I so badly wish we could all gain this mindset and keep it. How easy would life be.
Happy cake day and happy birthday! I'm sorry your friend bailed on you.
That's a pretty bad example ngl lol
Also his weird spiked haircut. I wanted spiked hair when I was like 6. I also wanted a mohawk. I'm not 6 anymore.
BREAKING NEWS: The new girl had to shred/chip a 6lb entire chub of Kentucky Gold ham today. Poor girl's arm ached the rest of the day.
I for one think that the military of no country should be this strong either.
No steel toe boots either. Amateurs. If the owner made his cooks do this instead of proper contractors he deserves a workers comp claim.
Hmm I thought I was playing the game for fun and excitement and unlocking skins was just an added bonus
"Thank you so much for your kind words, I didn’t think anyone would take the effort. "
Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.

Still don’t know how [NAME] said him and [NAME] will be battling for years while keeping a straight face.
"Gone but not forgotten. You will be missed, you will be forever loved."

I’m surprised alcohol isn’t entirely sold by the state like it is in many states in the East.
I didn't say remain was left wing. I said the E.U acts as a buffer against the most insane and cruel Tory policies.
Nah I didn’t get scammed but my money is sitting in the Dream Market escrow doohickey. Whatever that means! Haha!

Ok. I didn't know we discussed this topic. Have a nice day.
Now this is some good fucking content
I hate how much I love it
What's with the click? I don't get it... It ruins the joke *hangs up*
This guy probably just started watching football. These younger generations just aren't as educated as they used to be.
Wow now I know there's a twist. Why even watch it?
Wait so I shouldn't try to sell my shavers by telling my customers that they aren't good enough and could do better? Damn.

No problem. Glad you were able to take something away from that.
That would be me lol; glad it made you laugh
Man. Really bad last possession there. Bummer.
Can't believe he took the time to count that. They both seem a bit obssesed.
"You should see the absurd number of ""gays for [NAME]"" we have in my country, it's astounding"
"ah, it does me heart good to see NIMBYs in the wild"
I got silver the other month on this sub using interesting title
"It was once was mine too. Im starting to use it again. :) It is so fucking beautiful,"
The title made me laugh so much after reading this. Glad things are going great with your wife. Many more happy years to you three (:
It's not even the ads. It's the complete lack of anything worth watching between the ads.
I have a deep seeded hatred for close-minded people too.
"Block me,report me, do what you gotta do, you don't own reddit."
Sometimes people that are around each other a lot just get to be friends. Sometimes people ignore that their friends are actually terrible people.
You are oddly defensive about a random chef. Did you come to /r/wewantplates just to insult people and build up this chef? [NAME]
"Yeah, it’d be weird to have two green arrows running around. "
"No! You've gotta make it warm, let it sit in the sun and have all the sugar dissolve into it! THEN you chill it!"
Sounds like a fun game. Our home game around here is .05/.10. Its fun but not very exciting.
Could be depression with psychotic features. Talk to your doctor asap!
I watch his YouTube stuff. It's gross!
I loved it so much more than I thought I would! [NAME] does an amazing job with quite a bizarre concept!
I don't think that's true. Every major story I remember from the [NAME] investigation has been from court documents.
I got grounded from reading once and it was the worst punishment I ever had 🙂
Only 7? Wow he's slacking. He must not have very faithful parishioners.
">Dude, nobody reads. That is *really* not true. "

I moved to Canada in 2001 from the middle east. I'm still not used to it. I hate cold.
I'm so sorry. She's a very lucky cat to have people who love her so much.
Yes but that's largely changed in much of the US (the coasts at least). Surprised a state or two hasn't legalized it

He is warped by porn. He's got a problem
"Not everyone agrees that he was actually an amazing strategist or a great general, actually."
This not the first or second mistake by VAR against us.There was even an wrong offside against us some games ago and they didn't checked it.
To make money from money is disgusting and is screwing up the economy.
At home with a viral infection right now! Praying for death and to the god of paracetamol. Ugh.
What I find disgusting is thinking you can be a liberal and a ecologist. Anyone has its own ideas I guess.
It's always nice to tell someone a pleasant story before they go to sleep.
The cruelest people in the room are a pack of gormless dullards. It's the banality of evil for the 21st century.
"With that logic, women shouldn't be able to drive cars considering they are more prone to accidents/wrecks. Would you agree?"
Asleep at the switch! I wasn't asleep. I was drunk!
"[NAME], feel bad for that streamer, everyone has their moments on this game, it’s understandable"

He's practicing difficult shots too much thus loosing a feeling for easy ones.....
"Yep, it was faked. Too bad, too"
Wow thanks. Didn’t know there were any others glad to hear
It’s only missing a line that says “who was born in June” for absolutely no reason
"You would think so, huh? Not the first dude who has tried to use that rationale. The first one I dated though."
There's that NPC reply i was expecting.
You could even say that they don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band.
This isn't uplifting. This is *enraging*. This is what the government should be doing not nine-year-old fucking children.
Cloning shouldnt recreate sensitivity to the Force.
[NAME] please don’t come to the USA. We’d love to have you...but you don’t need to deal with this.
I was JUST thinking about how much I enjoyed Swalla la laaaa last night too!
Danm you can hear that little bastard squeaking.
It’s too cold to go outside most of the year. Whining into webcams is all they’ve got!
I love how the sun just decides its going to pull Australia from Earth and cuddle with us... If only it didn't burn so much.
"What?! Now you are just reaching bro. He's not even the best bodybuilder named [NAME], [NAME] has him beat."
Why else? Seems that it is just lack of imagination on your part.
"I am so upset for you and your family. She knew what she was doing, which makes this even more horrifying."
"Well for the relative dying, they can think the problem of evil is a contradiction and therefore not believe. That's legitimate"
"I don’t like [NAME] very much either, but she’s not a mess here. "
"Wow, that’s a big 3 year old!"

He looked so sad when he was talking about how it feels to be getting criticised 😢.
I'll be surprised if *Monty Python's Life of Brian* wasn't one of those.

I really pity those unfree Cuban babies. It’s just sad.
You didn't tell me there was a gas lesk!
"I love my kids. I don't always like my kids, but I love them. "
I actually like my vagina... I suspect it’s actually my husband that is the problem
Why was the discrimination and ghettoization of [NAME] prior to their extermination legal? Because legislators sometimes don't care for morality.
Pretty unlikely as those polls are worthless. Also there is no way GOP/Trump would have supported [NAME] over [NAME] if they thought he was the stronger of the two
Damn it. Don't mention [NAME]. Just makes me sad thinking what could have been.
"welcome to the community, my good dude!"
It really isn’t hard to put your chat in submode like every other pro player does.

The weight of all that water is enough to kill someone if they don’t drown.
"as a [NAME], trust me its not that great lol"
Can't help but feel that going down 3-0 is nerves and fear of playing someone with [NAME] mythology. AO to [NAME] is like RG to [NAME]

I cringed and flinched. That’s a bad day
"Mine is when my husband says our daughter’s emphysema is acting up. No, husband. Her eczema is. "

"I feel bad for her, talk to her :("
The amount of salt in this thread is overwhelming.
"I wonder why the fuck out of this alive. well, there was a perfectly reasonable explanation."
Yep. That will do it. Glad to hear the message finally sank in. Rehabilitation is the key to fighting recidvism.
Evil spirit! Leave from this place and never return!!
"I'll chase you till the ends of the eaaaaarth, Shooooooooooooooooooooooooooocker!!!!!!!"
That dress is made with industrial strength lycra/polyester and thread. I'm amazed it didn't blow up and kill innocent bystanders at the restaurant.
"[NAME] man, how have you not suffocated with your head so far up your ass?"
No need for pity! It was a happy moment. Tears of joy not sadness
Never listen to songs with someone you love. Just don't. Trust me.

"I swear, this is the most brutal one of this year yet. "
Her performance was absolutely awful in the Elseworlds crossover. So much so that every time she was on screen it made me cringe.
Hate to see him go. The only thing I’m complaining about besides this was the hagelin trade back in November. Both hit home
Wowza...you hit the roommate jackpot huh? She sounds unobservant and a special level of insensitive. Pray for her future patients.
He’s oppressed! An innocent man is going to be killed!
How did this not get marked as meta? Tried posting something similar here and it was instantly flagged as “meta commentary about the sub” and blocked.
Yikes that made me tense up. Not sure I was breathing. 10/10. Very painful looking
"Horrendous , this is also reflected in my experience act school where you are not allowed to defend yourself at all "
[NAME] account is 9 hours old. No way this is real.
"I always tried to go first if possible tbh. You're not gonna get away, might as get it over with quickly."
I know. Idk what to say after they say they already have one. I say oh good! And then it's awkward
Sounds really boring so I hope you like it
I hope all my muscles cringe so spastically all my joints come loose and I collapse into a writhing agonized pile of blood and meat.
This would be perfect for a new sub sound
"Not really. Also it’s Winnipeg, sorry we don’t have the population of Tokyo..."
I can't not pick Savor the Flavor when playing Stitches though. It's just too damn fun.
[NAME] it'd be funny if it weren't so pathetic.
It's just bizarre you would criticize [NAME] on his development capabilities when he's not a developer... His specialties are centered around crypto philosophy
"When you live where it's this cold, incessant complaining is a national pass time."
I laughed but unfortunately [NAME] is our problem because of how close Canada and USA relations are.
I know the author tried to find a picture that emphasize wealth/elitism but they’re toasting with water lmao

It's [NAME]. He hates himself for never getting the coat into the basket.

The double standard. Taking pictures of women without their permission is taboo and creepy.

Would love it if [NAME] showed up as church lady and played a solo on it.
"Stop making yourself human, just stay hollowed and you won't be invaded."
[NAME] made me like a sleep walker.. I did things I didn't remember doing. Scary.
Wow dude get a life and stop digging through my comments trying to pick a fight like a belligerent moron.
I think it was roughing and unsportsmanlike conduct for the chirp or something stupid like that. I couldn't believe [NAME] got away with that

"The SNP were, I remember [NAME] stridulating about it at conference, but I don’t think it was a go-er."
I once got flowers from a girl... idk why but it just feels good
That's a scumbag move by the prof. That exam is not at all an indicator of competence or understanding.
"I never imagined the world would get so weird that I *wanted* to believe the conspiracy theorists, but here we are."
Don't do [NAME] dirty like this smh
[NAME] will definitely turn to the dark side at the end of IX. This will leave fans on the edge for another 30 years before X.
Yeah.... I've always sucked at smiling honestly. I hate it. I hate selfies. I usually don't smile.
It’s a wonder [NAME] didn’t get more duis with the amount he needed to drink

Wow. If it shows calls on the bill then what good is it? Glad I asked...
[NAME] is scared out there. Didnt want the ball
That’s so incredibly rude and inaccurate. You can’t actually believe that.
That's really not that long ago given his age and this sort of thing is more than controversial.
Yep because running a blower for 5 minutes caused it. Not the millions of vehicles or factories we have.
Sorry I should have been more specific! A spiral chemical perm (I love curly hair!)
Holy crap. I need to listen to that speech in full on my commute home then.
Of course [NAME] doesn't like competition for his religious fantasies. That surprises no one.

The problem with writing vague laws in 2012 and then implementing then in 2017 is that things are huge changes that have taken place in that time.
Overall I'm 'gifted' but my processing speed is still below average
Sorry that you lost that stuff. But that's a lot to have in your car in SF

The amount of salt in this thread is overwhelming.
We have tradable assets next year and cap space the year after. We don’t need to implode to retool.
Same. But the 21 point lead drew me in.......who knew you can lose by double digits leading by that much.
Agree on the last point. My INTP friend's ENFP is immature since she's still young. Gets jealous at every damn girl that approaches... Sigh
You should dm her and say I'm sorry
Exactly! The mob mentality of these people is sad! Let's bring some love and peace into the world!
It's real and it plays SO OFTEN I CAN'T STAND IT!!

I didn't know [NAME] was a [NAME] Lord.
I genuinely cannot believe [NAME] didn't get fired years ago. It shocks me more than [NAME].
Plead not guilty and try your luck in court.
I feel like [NAME] would be upset about this too
I was in awe the whole hour I spent in there.
I like how you can see how it really looks with the minimap
Now you’re repeating yourself. Boy bye #wasteoftime. Have fun trying to call this company and their products bunk when everyone loves them haha
Ironic that that’s a false claim... BUT mao did directly cause the lives of 100million of his own people
Being the most hated team of the refs is fun huh guys?
Gonna be a much better game than the last one. So glad you guys are coming to carver
"We may not have much connection playerwise anymore, but Flames will always be Mr. [NAME] special Western buddies."
Ded game we should be happy we have a new hero

Must be nice my seats were in that area... sadly I decided to go to the bathroom. #PTSD
I’m guessing theyve been together for a few years and once she was no longer a teenager and it wasn’t as risqué he lost interest.
Not worth it. My family is the same way. I am scapegoat. I cut them all off and I have never been happier or more at peace
"By his comment I would say that he is in fact, a simpleton. So, too late."
"Ah, I read it wrong. Jzk. "
[NAME] gets eliminated the 3rd time she's in the bottom so this is wrong and [NAME] would have the best track record if this is true
Im glad your out too! Im glad you found joy in camping =)
You don’t have to hate players just for being on a different team. I hate that [NAME] is an [NAME]. I don’t hate [NAME]

Same.. I wonder why we catastrophize over these minor things so much and others seem to be able to forget them..
My ecology professor hated outdoor cats for that reason. They're extremely destructive animals.
Confronting people with footage from slaughter houses is a horrible thing to do in my opinion.
No. Screw him. It IS a demanding job. Physically and emotionally draining. You deserve a hot meal and a friggin hour or two to decompress.
What the fuck [NAME]! Are you easy to talk to? 29 years and you didn't see it coming?
Yeah if you fall into a tree hole there’s almost no chance of getting yourself out.
Huh.. Well that ruins it :/ At least the cats fine
I have never laugh cried so hard at a TV moment

The rest areas and truck stops are booming!
"My opinion is that this person's opinion is stupid, fallacious, and bad."
That... sounds like gibberish. I expose myself to it in that it's my life. The rest of that sentence makes very little sense.
This is the stupidest thing to get excited over (but I am)
Society started going downhill at exactly the point where I became negatively affected by social change.
"It's normal, don't worry too much about it."
"[NAME] blew it by putting [NAME] on the WS roster. He was horrible, and he hadn't pitched in weeks."
">Have a good time debating the people in your head, looks like you're having fun."
Might be an unpopular opinion but I actually enjoyed the faster ruck speed. Spewing they didn't stay strong and stick to their guns
"Actually feel sorry for her. She has depression and low self esteem, this is not going to make it better."
A car. Let someone else eat the immediate depreciation and break it in for you.
Not sure how you got that outta my post. I play a lot of non-meta stuff all the time just because I find it fun or challenging.
"College is a very lonely place. Very stressful, very lonely. [NAME]. Good luck out there man."
Chi snowing. Can't get a break.... Also I'm crushing it.
"Yeah people demonize salt but like that's the opposite problem with restricting, salt is my friend leave me out of it"
That gives you zero right or say over what someone wears. You are wrong.

Her license hasnt been revoked though ;( If purposefully giving people the wrong medecine isnt enough of a reason then idk what.
"Lol! Too funny. Mine are depressed, they gave up. :("
That is absolutely terrifying to me. Oh my god. The idea that she was trapped as a toddler her entire life is just... wow.
Not really. It's just that things you would do in Street Fighter to win are monumentally more difficult if you try to do them in MK.
How did they respond? You can't leave out the best part.
one of them shotting 22lr if I recall? Heck most the worst used a pistol ether exclusively or with a shotty too

"“What the FUCK is this [NAME], explain!”"
"I mean this in the least creepy way possible, tell me how it works out NO DETAILS PLEASE GOD NO"
I don't think cryptocurrency is ready for such using. Although in Asian countries like Singapore or Hong Kong it's quite acceptable I guess.
This has been largely disproven. [NAME] had no problem dropping the bomb and knew it wouldn't change the outcome of the war.
"But something is extremely wrong if people are getting sick. Might not be a sonic wave, but it definitely is *something*"
The article didn’t use it. OP just did a bad copy paste I think.
Tell her to stop eating shit and start using mouthwash.
"That's fucking awesome! I had no idea they would straight up off a dude for trifling! Lmao Winning information forsure, cheers man."
"Thank you for your feedback, I was just trying to tell you my reasoning behind it sorry if I came off as angry."
"Whoa, settle down big texter!!!! Not even sure how that happened?"
Bad execution but it made me smile through the cringe. The sentiment is definitely relatable.
It feels weird to me cause im the type of person who always immediately texts back
> It’s generally viewed upon as being one of the worst [NAME] games ever made. No it isn't. Source that claim.
"nah, my face is the farthest thing possible from cute ;-;"
I want to so bad it hurts. I guess I'm just scared.
"Lol, pinches narizones.. Their physical game is on another level. Would rather play with a guy like that instead of against him though that's for sure."
"No, they couldn’t hav- They shouldn’t have. uh...this makes me feel sick 🤕 "
Not really. Wish your mum was still a virgin to be truthful with you as then we wouldn’t have to read the nonsense you post on here
This post is so true Clothes these days are so bland
"yikes, as someone who dislocates things often ([NAME]), this scares me!"
I’m so happy for them. I hope he drowns in a puddle of bacon grease.
"Worse, he murdered King [NAME] in the most cowardly way possible. Both in the books and the show. "
I use to get this but now I just get ghosted.
Most [NAME] don’t really know the difference. Its an easy boogeyman.
Yeah father of two T1D. That post is insanely reactionary. My lord.
TBH I was worried he actually hurt [NAME]. Glad everyone is ok.
You are right but stick a cleanse on that bad boy and he's golden
I'd rather die than drive a Volvo!
If you had to think of a way to survive this how the hell would you. Damn
"Ok.... he can *call* it the State of the Union, but that doesn't mean it is."
No! That's horrible news!..for Galaxy fans lol
That's gonna be a no from me dawg.
sometimes i look up at the stars and i wonder if [NAME] is masterbating to our conversation somewhere out there
Seeing something as beautiful as this just made my day today! Thanks for sharing :)
"Gotta love these kids! When they do or say the cutest things like that, it really makes u melt....... Enjoy OP!!!"
"Thank you so much for the wonderful compliment, glad you enjoy it!"
The analogy was in relation to placing the blame for your unrealistic wants and needs on the person who is denying you them.
"Glad you enjoyed man, yeah it was pretty spontaneous too, I was praying I wasnt about to pull some bartard move and get jammed lol."
What the heck did I just watch
This sub has over 350k subscribers. How are there this many of us who enjoy this torture.
I live an hour from one but was afraid of driving all the way there and them telling me that I have to order one.
[NAME] is hot garbage on that court. He has been the biggest disappointment of any player this season.
"thats the future right there, robots trying to help but destroying your whole home in the process. "
"Fucking monophanie looking ass floating with the dead, nice."
[NAME] and [NAME] for [NAME] then sign [NAME] afraid this battle station is fully operational
I suppose. It was just weird how they went on a NASCAR tangent for like 3 minutes lol.
I’m really glad to read that ex-spouses are friends after. Good for you all!
"I actually feel bad for your roommate, poor guy."
"Exactly, but I guess I've gotten used to people forgetting the club exists haha"

That sounds awful. Do you like that schedule?
"The sad thing is, relatively speaking these are actually pretty good living conditions. Check out Harris Ranch."
"Or more aptly ""OHHHHH FUUUUUuuuck"" As you see me run away."
"Not at all. It's great of course for financial reasons, but it then makes me worried about how much time she'll have for a relationship."
They can't even really articulate what has been so bad since [NAME] took office.
You are saying toxic people try to be the victim by calling you toxic.
British would annoy me more. Or being called British Isles
That guy who melodramatically dances around playing horribly soppy poppy chord progressions over and over and does a cringy dance that makes me want to kill things?
Oh I'm not denying he is a scumbag who should be run out of town. Just whether this individual thing happened.
I'm always happy to have you in my box.
I don't think you've ever seen the dsm. If you knowingly do something stupid you don't deserve anything but what you get
SHIT. I just gave my son some Skittles. Lemme edit that right quick LOL
I like these kinds of multicultural projects. Very much in line with my feels about South Africa.
Aye the party left me. Now I'm stuck in with this old boys tadger staring me in the face.
"Oh, the ""Thomas the nuclear bomb""? That scarred me."
So that's how people get their cars sideways in those crazy pictures. I'd always wondered.
Oh look [NAME] piggy backing attention at the end there.
"I don't think WI is lean red, after 2018 I'd argue for it being either tossup or lean blue."
"Fiend! Take a good look at this silver cross, for it will be last thing you'll see of me and [NAME]!"
I understand just so hard feels like I’m being thrown away like trash I don’t want to imagine a life without her in it
"Damn, she was gonna clobber that punk with the butt of that gun."
Good luck to you! Cheers to a new year! 👍🏼
Maybe a relationship where you don't live together would suit him better. Some people feel suffocated when they are with their partner for long stretches of time.
Oh wow. Thanks! So this person was going for that.
Aw thats so sweet A loving cimmunity is what [NAME] and [NAME] deserve for giving us such amazing content every day
"Kings fan here, good luck to you guys! Will be an interesting game to watch! "
Yeah I don’t see any yellow. That’s a solid bright green to me.
We shouldn't be brigading other subreddits anyway.
It's all fun and games until your crush turns into a spaceship.
"*DRAINS, CLOGS, BACKED UP LOGS [NAME]!* *OH, NO, TOILET OVERFLOW [NAME]!*"
I'm so so so sorry this happened to you friend. I hope [NAME] had a lovely life 💗
We don’t “know” but it was reported he is expected to stay on. Really glad about it
Nice try hom... oh no it’s real this time D:
"I want to say I'm shocked. I'm not. Disgusted, but not shocked."
Not surprising since about 85% of all dating relationships end in a break up.
I get that but there may be some folks out there that aren’t like that. Any help would be much appreciated.
I'm glad you're safe - but don't feel sorry for him. He knows what he is doing.
Just did that. He ignored me and didn't respond.
Yes religious abuse by parents because their son dared question their religion
So deport the bad guys and let the asylum seekers come in. Sounds like we don’t need a wall anyway.
"wow it’s literally disgusting that you’re getting downvoted for pointing out that she abuses her kids. this is the society we live in, eugh"
Seems more first thought is to stop and make sure to call 911.
Because they enjoyhis music. Stop asking stupid questions in order to get attention
There seems to a bet between [NAME] and [NAME] whose semi final match would be more of a bloodbath
I mean if my wife looks like that when I get married then I’ll be quite happy.
Nothing. Fuck the environment so people can think they saved a few bucks. People are fucking stupid.
> its exactly the opposite of what I do to get a girl in the mood This is super creepy
">you said that other-country feminists cared about poor women and American feminists didn't Kali... you know I didn't, more or mostly does not mean all.."
The sad thing is that most of them are gone the next election anyway.
Damn it even comes with changeable speedshanks
"This exchange made my day. From a female doc, thanks for getting it. "
It's so focused on the presenter and he is so unengaging it's painful.
The stuff nightmares are made of. Those poor poor timelines.
"honestly, individually he's been awful so far."
"The happiest of birthdays to you, [NAME]!"
"Surprised to not see Three Arrows on the list when he went from no videos at all to over 100,000 subscribers just in the course of 2018."

"Ahhh okay my bad I misread your comment, I thought you meant we’d be trading him if he plays poorly "
"They get pissy about ""automatic defenses"" for property. I mean, *REALLY* pissy."
Being misunderstood really is the worst thing ever! I’m sorry some people are so unkind.
"Thank you so much for the wonderful compliment, glad you enjoy it!"
Drive thru is the worst. The number of times people would sneeze in my face at the window was infuriating.
Imagine your daughter running away from home. I think that's a pretty terrifying idea without some murderer or mystic horror
"To each according to their needs... Except entitled parents, who need everything."
How tf is this dumbass mf still internet popular like everyone hates him irl
I've been twice and both locations had a serious bee problem.
Zionism is the ISIS of [RELIGION]. Brainwashed idiots like ISIS.
And the Reds. I subbed over at r/Reds after [NAME] went over there and their excitement at things actually happening fills me with envy
This is way too far down. Probably the quickest 3 hour movie I’ve ever seen. Totally engrossing.
"You sure are outraged about some people making fun of [NAME]. Gee, that's easy!"
It kind of surprised us how much of a feeling of control it gave us.
> Take away the snow and it looks like an IU home game. Damn [NAME].

A new mattress if you can swing it. Company provided mattresses are typically pretty garbage.

Damn these refs actually fucking hate us.

This is amazing OP. Don't care if it's OC or not. This shit had me dying
Are they from a shithole or a civilized country? These are important questions.
"Pretty much, you have to ""atone"" tho."
"Oh man, I forgot about eBay! I have some old textbooks I’ve been meaning to put on there too."

Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants
The commies will be much less sympathetic if they get the chance.
[NAME] has been doing everything great except for shooting. It will start falling eventually
My soul twin must be [NAME] because I’m terrified of water!
He already sucks. Let’s just nerf him some more.
The Islanders don't play between January 22nd and February 1 and I swear to [NAME] I have no idea what I'm going to do with myself.
What have I watched ?! My eyes!!! Mom!!!
"Don't apologize it has nothing to do with you, everyone here understands that."
"Nurse here! There is no way they would ever relocate me to another hospital because of demand, another ward yes, not another location entirely!"

Wow what's it like to be so petty? (Fixed)
Fly out of KDVT? Love flying out there.
[NAME] earned it I think. He was godlike at world's. But [NAME] is the absolute worst S+ on this list.
"Whoa, should've said that in the post. Threats is not good. I'd find a way to live away from him asap. "
As far as I can tell that's not real. No announcement yet and people on twitter saying it's false
Most likely shock that had him so comatose.
"I’ve had a hard time finding stuff in the area, occasionally Construction Junction will have a decent old handsaw or two..."
"I don’t like [NAME] very much either, but she’s not a mess here. "
You guys really hate the Seahawks more than the Cowboys? Maybe I'm just old.

"Whoa, thanks for the in depth answer! "
"I use to play with colored pencils as a child, I also use to play with chapsticks and lipsticks too! They are very entertaining!"
And please do not dab unless you are at bingo.
Denigrating your opponents as either racist xenophobes or labelling them too stupid to understand the issue at hand will have that effect.
I still think he should have been the first goalie in the 2014 World Cup. But alas that injury ruined everything.
"Damn it, I only have 6 comments on this sub, I don’t qualify😞"
What if [NAME] just tricked everyone to make us appreciate the coach we had all along...
Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.
Eyebrow zits are the worst. I'd rather have a lip pimple than an eyebrow pimple. Also part of the fanclub for your eyes.
"Yeah, I’m at the dh store. so it’s far but not that far. People really are horrible. "
Omg [NAME] he’s there because you don’t listen. You ass!
"Seeing as how someone was raping her, it doesn't surprise me that much that the facility would be so negligent that they wouldn't notice the pregnancy."
"Oh man, I forgot about that! Which episode was that from?"
Her question was theology actually. I wasn't even answering about the rape at all.
The girl on the right got glass stuck in her leg poor girl
I'd rather not be in the 90's kid category anyways.
Yes! Tell us E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G! She’s horrible but also very entertaining!

I used to do the same exact thing! Now I love the fat on my steak and watching them cut it off in japanese restaurants makes me sad.
Oh look a [NAME] flair why am I not surprised
They killed [NAME] for being a [NAME] right after this. [NAME] was a notorious anti-Semite.
His video is definitely against the rules.. He literally asks people to spam oh yeah yeah everywhere
"Glad to hear it’s open again, great spot. I still class climbing Coonowrin as the stupidest thing I’ve ever done."
"Thanks for the encouragement, it means a lot! Glad you liked it, seeya around 👌"

Sorry for your loss; this story is heartwarming.
If that's the best you got for being against libertarians then you basically have no serous reason.
I was at the game at there was a huge Laker fandom there. It felt almost like an away game.
Hmmm I dont think I listen to only [NAME] if I last checked. These arent INTP playlists they're just playlists I like as an INTP
People need to quit flagging this post. If you come to r/stlouis then you are well aware we hate the Rams and [NAME].
I must of not fully understood what you meant... damn tired redditing
"Huh, never heard of that term before. Something new every day!"
Idk you seem pretty miserable and really bitter and angry. It must be exhausting and I hope you find happiness some day.
